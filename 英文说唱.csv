That's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb
Only time I'm in my mind, when I'm all alone
That's why I'm never really  alone in the night time
Change hoes like clothes, I can't get attached
'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches
I've been feeling really lost, ducking all attachments
I don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic
I don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic

Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step, right
You agree
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect
Leaving you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, no, would I
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go
And let you walk
Well, broken hearts break bones
So break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go
So in my grave I'll rot

27853227,Rap God,https://music.163.com/song?id=27853227,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance(Six minutes, six minutes)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble – and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half **** it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his *******
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
Packing a mack in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a mother******' table
Over the back of a couple of ******s and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxi-Pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this **** ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, and did nothing but shoot for the moon since (PPEEYOOM)
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-W-A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and being in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the mother******' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking, tell me what in the **** are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a ********
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I got a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for ****, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keep up with the same pace looking boy
Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Marshall Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the **** that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with ******* cornrows
You're like normal, **** being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a mother******' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, **** you
I'm drunk so Satan take the ******* wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more symphatetic to the situation
And understand the discrimation
But **** it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the **** am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not—why be a king when you can be a God?

What did you learn at school today ?

That's what the teachers used to say

But they don't know

Don't understand, do they ?

Why do they always give advice ?

Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""

When it's been a long since they had (Let's Go) a teenage life

What did you learn at school today ?

That's what the teachers used to say

But they don't know

Don't understand, do they ?

Why do they always give advice

Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""

When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life

Dwelling on the past, from back when I was youngThinking of my school days and trying to write this song

Classroom schemes and dreamsMan they couldn't save me

Cos my days were numbered when I signed down on Ivy?

Teenage kicks running out what could we doI still show respect to my boys who made it through

And getting told off Mr T how my life would be
Then giving him a signal So everyone could see Sunshine and shade

Those girls I'd serenadeThinking of those sixth form chicks that misbehave

Hoping that those days would go on and on foreverEvery day something new
Just friends running together But suddenly school ends Your teenage life gone

All your mates are growing up now They're moving on

And now I'm looking back I'll tell you what I know Do you listen to your teacher ?

No I don't think so

""What did you learn at school today?""

That's what the teachers used to say

But they don't know

Don't understand, do they ?

Why do they always give advice

Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""

When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life

Now if you treat the kids fine, together they will shine yeha yeha
Ooh ooh ooh shine

And if you treat the kids fine，they won't do the crime yo yo

Won't do the crime

Now my bad old ways Were during my school days Messing on those grade A's My life is just a haze

I'm going through the struggle Five ten and kicking back So I could lock my flow Lace it up now on the track

Oh yeh I felt the pain Whilst chasing all the fame I'm being told I'm nothing Just a player in the game

But now I walk tall Stand proud for you to see I'm driving these fast cars It's five stars for me

""What did you learn at school today?""

That's what the teachers used to say

But they don't know

Don't understand, do they?

Why do they always give advice

Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""

When it's been a long since they had a teenage life.

Tell the World that I'm coming
Back where I belong yeah I never felt so strong
（I'm back baby）
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
And if you with me put your hands high
（Put your hands high）
If you ever lost a light before this ones for you
And you the dreams are for you
I hear ＂The Tears of a Clown＂
I hate that song
I feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another Dawn
Another Keisha nice to meet ya get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff it's harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask why I aint marry their mom （why damn! ）
How do I respond
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Damn! But I aint finished growing
Another night the inevitible prolongs
Another day another Dawn
Just tell Taneka and Taresha I'll be better in the morn
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home I'm coming home
Tell the World that I'm coming
＂A house is Not a Home＂ I hate this song“
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone
And n-ggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But oyu felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin
Pour out some liquor play ball and we keep ballin
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone come on
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home I'm coming home
Tell the World that I'm coming
＂Ain't No Stopping Us Now＂ I love that song“
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
We back cruising through Harlem Viso blocks
It's what made me saved me drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights lot of scars lot of bottles
Lot of cars lot of ups lot of downs
Made it back lost my dog （I miss you BIG）
And here I stand a better man! （a better man）
Thank you Lord （Thank you Lord）
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the World I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home I'm coming home
Tell the World that I'm coming

Somedays I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but your trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
Because your voice always helps me to not to feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around a call
And when I pick up I don't have much to say, so
I want you to know its a little **** up that

Used to barbeque with burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every halloween with candy by the pow
but now you only stop by every once in a while

With anything to keep the though of you from my mind
I'm doing fine and I plan to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

Tired of sitting here and waiting and makeing these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling sorta useless
It seems that one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you've got till its gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can say

Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere

I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the Kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry

Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboards, and I brought my boys with me

Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping mai tai
Sitting courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives

But I got a gang of ****** walking with my clique, though

Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rock

For foreigners that ain't fifty, they act like they forgot how to act

Eight million stories out there, and they're naked
Cities is a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I gotta plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy payin' LeBron, I'm paying Dwyane Wade

So they can step out of bounds quick
The sidelines is blind with casualties
Who sipping life casually, then gradually become worse

Don't bite the apple, Eve, caught up in the in crowd
Now you're in style, end of the winter gets cold
En vogue with your skin out, the city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the cities filled with them

Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends

Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion

1058415,You were my everything,https://music.163.com/song?id=1058415,"
This goes out to someone that was
once the most important person in my life

I didn't realize it at the time
I can't forgive myself for the way i treated you so
I don't really expect you to either
It's just... i don't even know

Just listen...

You're the one that i want' the one that i need
The one that i gotta have just to succeed
When i first saw you' i knew it was real
I'm sorry about the pain i made you feel
That wasn't me; let me show you the way
I looked for the sun' but it's raining today
I remember when i first looked into your eyes
It was like god was there' heaven in the skies
I wore a disguise 'cause i didn't want to get hurt
But i didn't know i made everything worse
You told me we were crazy in love
But you didn't care when push came to shove
If you loved me as much as you said you did
Then you wouldn't have hurt me like i ain't ****
Now you pushed me away like you never even knew me
I loved you with my heart' really and truly
I guess you forgot about the times that we shared
When i would run my fingers through your hair
Late nights' just holding you in my arms
I don't know how i could do you so wrong
I really wanna show you i really need to hold you
I really wanna know you like no one could else know you
You're number one' always in my heart
And now i can't believe that our love is torn apart
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And i really miss you
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And i really miss you
I knew you gonna sit and play this with your new man
And then sit and laugh as you're holding his hand
The thought of that just shatters my heart
It breaks in my soul and it tears me apart
At times we was off i was scared to show you
Now i wanna hold you until i can't hold you
Without you' everything seems strange
Your name is forever planted in my brain
Damn it' i'm insane'
Take away the pain
Take away the hurt
Baby' we can make it work
What about when you
Looked into my eyes
Told me you loved me
As you would hugged me
I guess everything you said was a lie
I think about it' it brings tears to my eyes
Now i'm not even a thought in your mind
I can see clearly' my love is not blind
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And i really miss you
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And i really miss you
I just wish everything could have turned out differently
I had a special feeling about you
I thought maybe you did too
You would understand' but...
No matter what' you'll always be in my heart
You'll always be my baby

Our first day' it seemed so magical
I remember all the time that i had with you
Remember when you first came to my house?
You looked like an angel wearing that blouse
We hit it off' i knew it was real
But now i can't take all the pain that i feel
Reach in your heart' i know i'm still there
I don't wanna hear that you no longer care
Remember the times? remember when we kissed?
I didn't think you would ever do me like this
I didn't think you'd wanna see me depressed
I thought you'd be there for me' this i confess
You said you were my best friend' was that a lie?
Now i'm nothing to you' you're with another guy
Y tried' i tried' i tried' and i'm trying
Now on the inside it feels like i'm dying
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And i really miss you
I need you and
I miss you and
I want you and
I love you 'cause
I wanna hold you
I wanna kiss you
You were my everything
And i really miss you
And i do miss you
I just thought we were meant to be

I guess now' we'll never know

The only thing i want is for you to be happy

Whether it be with me' or without me

I just want you to be happy

Everytime I'm layin' down a track
Man, I gotta keep it crackin'

Julia Stiles, I got
Hello matey it's me, the so shapely overweighty fat ****
I'm ice-cream cone crazy
Oreo tasting, my father don't praise me
With a beach ball gut like I carry my own baby
Skin so flakey like a painting in the Louvre (true)
Socially awkward, I'm strange and I'm aloof
They made me in a petrie dish, raised me in a tube
Now I'm driving round the city with a lady in my boot (let me out)
Innately I'm frustrating, just a vacant kinda dude
Go walking like I'm Walter, wake up naked in a fugue
Too many buegs and I'm slower than the YouTube sloth
Want to **** with me? You do not
I'm fat, you should see me with my muumuu off
Now rappers want to kiss me where my do-do was
See I smuggled in some googs in my Fubu socks
Catch me going ******* mental in a Bluejuice mosh
Julia Stiles, I got
Julia Stiles, I got
Julia Stiles, I got
(So I can go on?)
It's the fat **** boy with the flabby gut
Breathing down the phone, you're like go away, I'm hanging up
But can he bust quicker than a junkie with his bally up
Been days since smacking up, don't even get me angry, punk
See I'm frustrating myself to be around me
I'm like a twelvie towny, a real freaking downy
Found me in your driveway, just tryna key your Audi
Wake up crying in a sweat from a dream of Bieber drowning
Astoundingly disgusting, there's really nothing there
In my brain, so deranged, I feel pain punching air
Cause I can't mow the lawn and the neighbours love to stare
And my dad's like, ""yeah, you gotta grow a ******* pair""
And my life is Solitaire but I'm too dumb for cards
Too hyper for Monopoly, I'm too drunk for bars
More obese than Toadie, got a humongous arse
Tryna **** all the time like I'm Susan and Karl
I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair
I hate the way you drive my car, I hate it when you stare
I hate your big dumb combat boots and the way you read my mind
I hate you so much it makes me sick, it even makes me rhyme
I hate it, I hate the way you're always right, I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry
I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call
But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close
Not even a little bit, not even at all

For one moment that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment that it's too soon to forget
In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped money clip phone flip the six range
I seen her on the Ave spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi shot me a glance
In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants hot damn!
What's your name love where you came from
Neck and wrist laced up very little make-up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of
I tried to play it low key but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like ""Yo I'm leaving now""
An hour later sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up shaking winding her waist up
Scene 2 my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Ayo this my man Mos baby let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!) it was the same pretty bird
Who I had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling ""Oh I'm fine"" My name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes sweet voice is ******* with me mentally
We conversated made her laugh yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo she wild sweet yo
I'm 'bout to murk I say peace to the family
She hop up like ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me""
She blew my whole head with that duke I was like word
I played it low though I was like yeah aight come on then let's go
****** was mad ****** was so sick I tell ya
Yo honey was so blazing she was just
Yo she looked like Jayne Kennedy word bond to my mother man
She was that ill man she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me and s**t
""Yo let me apologize for the other night
I know it wasn't right but baby you know what it's like
Some brothers don't be coming right I understand I'm feeling you
Besides can I have a dance ain't really that original""
We laughed about it traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered ""Honey let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3 weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids the room fell silent
She walked away smiling singing Gregory Isaacs
Like ""If I don't if I don't have you""
Showing me her tan line and her tattoo
Playing Sade Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O. come now I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks rocking the P-funk
C**king her knees up champion lover not ease up
Three months she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning she gone like it was magic
Ahh damn it my s**t is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week Mu hit me up I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

Gaudiere style lenses, talents in the 40 cal
This is life now, let me find out
You want the life style of mine, no pal of mine
Runnin' with goons, with knife wounds from jail time
Got the squad lookin' like tycoon, we all shine
While we parle with the flyest mommy of 25th street
Watch how honey in the Lex do it
I'm in the 6 V with the 12 next to it
You wanna stick me, then put ya best to it
I die black, we see you in Allah Kingdom, you try that
Check the fly cat, 2 point 5, multiply that
Cash rules on my arm, I flash jewels and tatoos
You can look but don't touch, we bad news
American Me, elgancy, treasury
With the hopes to be rich before they bury me
Born a Baptist but moved on to higher practice
My fire ashes, only macks I interact with
We all dons, strong arm, all on calm
But if it's war we on, comin' for ****** who crossed me wrong
Select features, sit back, connect the pieces
Inject the thesis, spoke to my pops and left him speechless
He saw me sprout, goin' through worlds that wore me out
Never call me out, ******* and money, that's what we all about
Through all the routes landed here
Beach houses with the chandaliere, me and my crew
Mad cans of beer, it's copin', live vibe, still eyes open, it's clear
Presidential Suites at the Tangiere
How you livin' on your block?
Mine's is hot, how you livin' on your block?
I got it locked, what's goin' down on your side, who got shot?

Yeah, alright I'll meet you up top
Yo, it's hard to shake this feelin' that I might get knocked
Don, you know it don't stop, we can't close up shop
V V Sin', nuttin' less than how we steppin'
Coupes kidded, cuties wear the sleazy dress and
See me flexin' through the hood, d's be stressin'
Illegal search, tryin' to find weapons for gun possession
Never want for questions, every move made is destined
Black professors, let's take it back to the essence
Another version of the Goldie, mack, pimp servin'
Convince the urban project, ghetto prince emergin'
Half Hispanic, hollow tips, massive damage
The path was granted, loaded gats, blast the cannon
Chipped up, live by morals, don't get it mixed up
Dis what? Millionaire strut with the Crist cup
Switched up, slow goin', gold showin'
Doe flowin', eyes don't lie, hoes knowin'
Main attraction, lace love in the latest fashion
Trained in mackin' never, rockin' Gators clashin'
Assorted wear, AZ, firm extrordinaire
Make it more severe, lockin' **** down all this year
Nowhere to go from here but the top of this sphere
Nuttin' stoppin' us here, we lockin' this here
With the black toaster by my hip bone, **** a holster
See me at the Copa, platinum choka
The God's with me, mad blunt smoke, it's hard to miss me
Pick one out of two dimes to twist me
New nines is crispy, mind on chips, rhyme on ****
That's strictly made for cats who's rich
Excuse me, is that your ***** in my 6
Turnin' up the volume when she hear my hits?
On her wall mad flicks, now you want me blasted
But don't get it confused over this rap ****
Kinda laced, lookin' at diamonds in my onyx face
Oyster perpetual Roly with the day and date
Y'all playa hate this to fly for female singers
Who get face lifts and fake titties
We rule the world and take cities, I dreamed that his son
Happy we made it past the jakes, fakes and fiends of the slum

The UK and the USA
Paradox and Melodiq, poetic like sonnets
Words come alive, these lyrics keep flowing

Melodiq, Pat D, Lady P sounding sweet
The UK and the USA
Paradox and Melodiq, poetic like sonnets
Go together like treble and bass

Music’s meaning is more than the words, it’s the feeling
The passion, the soul, writing late in the evenings
It breathes in the records like turn to the ceiling
Motivated dreaming, back to what believing
It’s been in hearts, on tracks in vain
It’s seen in awe on graff on trains
The media try to attack its name
But the realness can’t be attached to fame
But who am I to say what hip-hop is?
Hip-hop was before Paradox lived
Before Yo! MTV Raps got big
When the soul and the words was what made hop hits
DJs rock kicks after digging in the crates
Now we’re living in an age where the rhythm is misplaced
It’s all about the chains, the millions you make
So I sit back, imagine as I listen to the greats

Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
It’s real hip-hop
Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
What’s it worth?

Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
It’s real hip-hop
Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
Some say it’s still the same, it ain’t that

It’s the authentic, all the time prolific, lyrical extraordinaire
Got rhymes to share, to educate the masses
Toasting the realness, raise your glasses
Never underestimate the movement
Always keeping my ear to the pavement
That’s what the pioneers did back then
Before they had two 12s making the blend
No emails to send, only word of mouth
Seems that real hip-hop is in a drought
Critics kept saying that it wouldn’t last
Through the years it persevered and made cash
Somehow it grew up too fast
Matured incorrectly, evidently
Now it’s time to do my thing
With ill flows and vibes that I bring no doubt

Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
It’s real hip-hop
Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
What’s it worth?

Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
It’s real hip-hop
Hip-hop, some say it’s still the same
Now let’s take a sec to think back

Gangstarr
JD
Common Sense
Large Pro
Nas
Pete Rock
Tribe Called Quest
KRS was number one

Just being in here
Is a humbling experience to me
Because you’re looking through all these records
And it’s sort of like a big pile of broken dreams in a way
Almost none of these artists still have a
A career, really
Ten years down the line you’ll be in here
So keep that in mind when you start thinking like
“Oh yeah, I’m invincible and I’m the
I’m the world’s best or whatever
Because that’s what all these cats thought

Well leave it up to me to come tight with mine
DJ Glaze one time with the bomb ass rhyme
slidin round the beach with the west coast sound
and if I see you on my team then I just might clown
325 with the chrome Anterra
caddy blue paint make them skirts wanna stare at me
as I dips around the way
and ya know its all good like them OGs say
now I'm freestylin to a brand new track
and its bumpin like the back of a 83 Lac
but dont get me in no twist
because I never thought we'd ever see a day like this
T-Dubb's in a Fleetwood and ya can't fade it
M's in a six-fo and its gold plated
from here on out its smooth sailin
so let me bounce like zap and keep bellin

Listen to the sound when we pass it around
as we buzz around the world with the west coast sound
you can just clown or be down wit it
but I'm a keep bouncin around wit it

Now I'm comin in leanin, crawlin and creepin
dippin in the ride and I'm hoppin when I'm leavin
layin low, blowin smoke out my nose
got some gin in my lap and now I'm ready to roll
so I'm a make all you fools recognize me
cuz I get more skirts between the sheets than the Isleys
and gettin loaded is how we kick it
if ya down come hang wit the sly slick and wicked
slappin bones wit the homeys
tossin up 40s, rollin in a fo with a skirt bumpin oldies
get my hustle on whenever ends one mo
dice in my pocket what they hittin fo
hittin ventures on the one time can get caught up
since that three strike rule got brought up
head to the bud spot and pick up an ounce
and dip back to the hood, fool and I'm out

Listen to the sound when we pass it around
as we buzz around the world with the west coast sound
you can just clown or be down wit it
but I'm a keep bouncin around wit it

Here I come bouncin, slidin, glidin
headed to the front Long Beach eastside
hop front and back let me scoop up M
cuz he's sittin in the park and he's all bombed in
I'm feelin kinda fine so you know whats right
layin back bumpin Tonight's The Night
so may I continue as the story unfolds
I love to see them skirts do the tootsie roll
with a hell of a body, no shame in the game
so hurry up and pass T-Dubb the Mary Jane
as I'm leanin out the window of a droptop fo
sippin Christian Brothers Lina pour me some mo
dippin, flossin, creepin and crawlin
feelin like a real OG cuz we ballin
hit the switch now scrapes the ground
and thats how I clown when I'm puttin it down

Listen to the sound when we pass it around

Where savages fought and pastors taught

And badges screaming,""Young black children stop or I will shoot!""

And I'm guilty for materialism

So save me your sorries, I'm raising an army

 Off her back, jab her if she act

 Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
 Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics

 Then **** your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
 She don't remember ****! Just the two hits!
 Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the ****s!
 Sucking on the ****! Had the ****** beggin for the ****
 And your moms ain't ugly love; my **** got rock quick
 I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
 I was ""****in Around"" and ""Jump-in Around""
 Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, ""B-I-G""
 Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)

 Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
 Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
 Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
 Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
 Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
 I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
 Hit mummy in the tummy if the ****** plays a dummy
 Slit the wrist of little sis
 After she sucked the ****, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
 Because he wanted me to **** him from the back
 But Smalls don't get down like that
 Got your father hiding in a room; ****** him with the broom
 Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
 Who you think you're dealing with?
 Anybody step into my path is ******* feeling it!
 Hardcore, I got it sucked like a *****
 Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me
 I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the *****

 Because you know I love it young, fresh and green

If I would give it to you, would you tear that ***t apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm ***ning bright just like a light cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki and she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
I'm go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but ***** I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried bout ***t, these *****s ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
*****s say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul
I ain’t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
Cause all these mother******s turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be ***t but a god damn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know
Toke
Took a drag out that wood now she goin for my wood
So we going to my hood
Yea she gonna get it good
And she know who we are
She want this rock star life and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah she off a bar and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no more

And to the dumb ***** in my science lab
How'd it feel when we fall and you caught the jab?

Used to fantasize, makin' love with her behind the bleachers
And to all the people who ain't like me, I ain't like me either
Half my class was havin' kids,
Guess we had that jungle fever, uh
I was waitin' for my graduation, growin' impatient
I didn't know, what's in this grown up world
Was just school in a blown up world
There's still gossip,
There's still drama, there's still problems
There's a right and there's a wrong
There still people that I think won't love me 'til I'm gone
Lowkey miss the days walkin' 'round in my school halls
But now I got a bigger job, the world screamin' my songs
Huh, as we go on we remember
All the times we spent together
As our lives change from whatever
We will still be friends forever
Bourne is such a ***** (I know, right?)
I don't even understand why guys like her, she's not even cute
She's not even pretty
Have you seen how much make-up she wears?
And by the way she facetune her pictures so much
I honestly think she bought her followers
She barely gets any likes any way (Mmm, she's honestly kinda sad)
And you wanna' know the craziest part about all of it? (What?)
She doesn't even have any idea her's boyfriend's
Been cheatin' on her this entire time (Huuh!)

Spell my name right, B-I, Double-G, I-E
Iced out lights out, me and Ceasar Leo
Gettin head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather

No seeds ******* please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the Hood, ain't no love lost

Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out for the rope, sent by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh,

And I see fire ,hollowing souls
I see fire ,blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a ***** can't rest in the West
See some nice breasts in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all *****z is a mess
Thinkin I'm gon stop, givin L.A. props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
I'm going going, back back, to Cali

Oh, should my people fall
then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father, oh,
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burnon andon the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance

Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Paid a visit to Versace stores

These girls wanna tie a kid down and keep me around
But I would never change; I’m a dog, I’m a hound
But I tell them what they wanna hear
They like how it sounds
Till I’m gone with the wind and I’m lost, never found
I met her at my show, then we smashed right after
If we go three rounds then she'll fall in love faster
The very next morning I’m Casper
In another city for a show somewhere getting plastered
It’s a disaster; to her I’m a drug
I do her kinda dirt, but they still fall in love
And I don’t understand it, foreign chicks on me
And she speak another language like she from another planet
She struggle when I’m gone, It’s hard when I leave
Being Ricky Pen, wear my heart on my sleeve
And she tell me that she love me but it’s hard to believe
Cause I’m coming and going, then I cum then I leave
And I swear I’m really not that shady
But you can’t blame me for who I’ve met lately
Nowadays chicks wanna call a kid baby
As soon as they find out I rap, s**t's crazy
But I do play along, yo I can’t front
I give in to every groupie with a fat butt

Ni pour personne d'autre !
On tient juste à dire que... le pont qui mène au succès
Est un pont fragile

J'ai demandé pardon sans qu'on puisse me l'accorder
J'ai demandé ma route sans qu'on puisse me l'indiquer
J'ai troqué mes études contre un disque de platine
Tout en sachant qu'tôt ou tard ton public te piétines
J'ai vu les choses en grand, j'ai du temps, j'ai du talent
Je reste sur mes gardes, je n'suis qu'un homme
Ça capture mon image dans des 7D Canon
Tout ça j'le fais pour moi, ceux qui doutent et la daronne

J'ai pété les plombs! (J'ai pété les plombs)
J'ai quitté l'école! (J'ai quitté l'école)
Si seulement tu savais (Si seulement tu savais)
Tout le mal que je garde (Tout le mal que je garde)

C'est ma direction!
J'ai pété les plombs, sans abandonner ni baisser les bras
Plus d'nouvelles, batterie faible, malédiction
Dorénavant, je vais de l'avant, c'est ma direction
Ma direction

J'ai fuis les sonneries, les bruits d'chaises
Moi j'cherchais d'autre style de richesses
Du journal d'Anne Frank à c'lui d'Bridget
J'ai jamais kiffé lire depuis qu'j'ai
12 piges, malgré les ratures j'gratte le papier
C'est ma direction, j'me suis pas éparpillé
Plaqué plus d'une fois, dos au re-mu
Trop fier pour demander d'l'aide au RMI
Les srabs en guise de mif, l'estrade en guise de but
Freiné par les fils de chhhut...
J'me souviens qu'à la base on voulait même pas toucher d'blé
Ça rappait sale quand on s'entassait tous chez le Blanc
Tu connais BatiPro, Crit, Selpro
J'écrivais dans l'trom avant d'aller m'casser l'dos
Aujourd'hui tout ça n'aurait pas d'sens
Sans tous ces sacrifices, sans toute cette patience

C'est ma direction !
J'ai pété les plombs, sans abandonner ni baisser les bras
Plus d'nouvelles, batterie faible, malédiction
Dorénavant, je vais de l'avant, c'est ma direction
Ma direction

J'me remémore les clashs, les concours de rap, la hass
Dans la rue ça rappe en masse, ça zappe même d'aller nehess
Pour un 16 mes gars t'agressent, seul le kickage nous apaise
Nos voix, nos mains s'élèvent quand les flics sales nous rabaissent
Le rêve est à nos pieds donc on dort tête bêche
On baigne dans les richesses mais nos lèvres restent sèches
J'veux vivre de ma passion car tous les taffs me déplaisent
On cherchait que la reconnaissance on voulait pas parler d'espèces
Maintenant on fout dehors la hass même si nos passés l'heberge
Ça veut acheter des caisses, attaquer l'marché des States
Si on a autant ramé, c'est pour être stock à l'arrivée
Pour bien steaker les stre-mon qui voulaient nous faire chavirer
Mais ça taf j'ai quitté pour mieux déplacer des montagnes
Résultat, ma foi baisse, mes fautes sont indénombrables
Cherche pas trop la lumière, le soleil brûle ta peau
Ouais le succès te fume, à peine tu l'crapotes

C'est ma direction !

**** le taff... un bac pro ça paye pas
Avec les srabs, pour le rap bah on veille tard
Malgré les découverts, les sales patrons
J'ai tout plaqué à la conquêtes des salles, partons!
Un projet suicidaire, ça passe ou on se casse
Et tu nous suis si t'aimes akhi
Determinés, on part au front sans armure
Et les plus terre-à-terre disent qu'on foncent dans un mur (Aah!)
Les darons savent pas c'que j'fais, ils disent que j'dors
Ils pensent que leur fiston ne vit que dehors
Sans savoir qu'ce p'tit con prépare des disques d'or
Et tout ceux qui le négligent bah on plus que tort
J'sais où j'vais, sans savoir si j's'rais le bienvenu
J'suis pas invité et j'suis accompagné d'OVNIs
J'me dirige vers la gloire et les blèmes-pro
La musique est une femme à problèmes mais putain j'l'aime trop

C'est ma direction !

Miss my family on the east, but **** it I can't leave L.A
Every meeting that I be in, trust me I just lead the way
I ****** three times before 3 today, piece of cake
Never gave a **** about what the teacher say, cause either way
I'mma just do me and she said me too, I said ""s'il vous plaît""
Walking out the club with me and TMZ is out here
Ain't no secret safe
If that's your girl, why's she in my section?
If that's your girl, why's she doing role play
Going both ways like an intersection?
Stole her like an interception
But you can have her back she asks a million questions
Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, ****
Cause god damn that body's goals as ****

You ain't the only one
Stro, Talk to me
Everything I see up in my head just comes to life
Got my day-ones rollin' round with me on every single flight
Yeah that's right, that's my life
Spoil everyone that's with me
Made it rain in Vegas with the MVP, J.D. no whiskey
And lately I've been stressing because I just miss my family
They see the smiles but never the pain and all the success they see
Allegedly there's some stereotypes I don't like about my height

Prove 'em wrong, prove myself right
Cloudy days, smile so bright, 14 lifts, 7 days, fortnight (yikes)
I can't lie, I been on a mission
To make every single doubter eat their words up in their kitchen
Yeah, my vision is to get it while I'm living
I'll keep winning
Legendary comeback, ACL incision, yeah
I've been doing great I guess I can't complain
I don't think about yesterday
Every move is calculated, this **** ain't no guessing game
Only time I'm second place is when I'm at my second place
Made 300 then doubled that, I guess you call that 2nd base
How many come ups until it's destiny
How many come ups until it's meant to be
I hear them talking, that don't get to me
That ain't **** to me, same dude, different dream
This is me
This is me
Ain't nothing pretty but her face
Money hungry, nothing skinny but her waist
She come from money, but she spent it on her titties and her face
If you really wanna know, these women, man they come and go
Cause one minute she's the one, the next you really never know
Cause she don't know a damn thing about love
She don't know a damn thing, at all
Cause one minute she's the one
The next you really never know

 Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it

 And your girlfriends, but being that she's a big fan, of course she made it

 Will I see again (Tryin' different drugs and girls)

 Mixing drinks, knowing we'll regret this
 Ain't been asleep yet, room service bringing us breakfast
 All this money, darling, what else is left to do

 Got a swimming pool in my living room

17565951,Goodbye To You (+ Dot Rotten),https://music.163.com/song?id=17565951,"Hey...
Can you hear me?
I just wanted to let you know...
Hmm...
I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said there were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.
And of the pieces of my soul...
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time...)
You know I never want to be alo-on-on-one...
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...
I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out? '
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope Warreen, Lauren
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny

She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you
And of the pieces of my soul...
(Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time...)
You know I never wanna be alo-oh-oh-one...
I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...
It's just for now so I should hush...
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...
It's just for now so I should hush...
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...
There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was rapeing his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face,
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you...?

The wrath of Kane, taking over your circumference
Destroying negativity and suckers that come with
The weak, the wack, the worse, the poor
I thrash, bash, clash, mash... and then more
Blow up the scenery, I reign supremacy
You need a savior to save ya so lean on me
I'm playing rappers like a haunted ghost
And stomp 'em out like a wanted roach
I slay my prey and they decay
I blow away and throw away, so go away
'cause I don't play
Attacking like a psychopath
Breaking rappers in half
So feel the wrath, of Kane
""The name is Big Daddy, here to bring trouble to""(x4)
The man at hand to rule and school and teach
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most and boast the loud and proud
The Kane'll reign your domain (Yeah Kane!)
The heat is on so feel the fire
Come off the empire, on a more higher
Level than def, one step beyond ****
The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
Cause I can never let 'em on top of me
I play 'em out like a game of Monopoly
Let 'em speed around the board like an Astro
Then send 'em to jail for trying to pass Go
Shaking 'em up, breaking 'em up, taking no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So Mister Cee, let the volume grow so I can flow
Now yo, Juice Crew's the family, Slick Rick's a friend of me
And Doug E. Fresh, Stet, KRS and Public Enemy
Blahzay Blah, you know who you are
The red, black and green, the sun, moon and star
Knowledge of self is being taught here on after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reaching each
With the speech every leech I'll impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb, deaf and blind'll feel the wrath, of Kane
""The name is Big Daddy, here to bring trouble to""(x4)
Marley Marl, break it down!
Bring it back, Cee~
Line by line, chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street, I gotta rap to
Those who chose to oppose, friend or foes
I still dispose, and blow 'em out like afros
So many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yelling and screaming and dreaming but still came out
Off the wall and butter soft to y'all
So you waited for Kane to come forth to all
Competition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch
To play me out position, you on a mission
So stop lying and trying to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze, as I get warm like a heater
You bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
Or phrase that pays, so you dine on mine
Instead of fronting and trying to be a friend of
You might as well say guess who's coming to dinner
So just quit, submit and forget
Huh, you must be on some new improved ****
I get busy from sun to sun
I'm only 21 and untouched by anyone
No one throws, bangs or blows
All foes, I keep 'em running like pantyhose
They get soft and tender, front and then surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on your class, force, team or staff
But when I'm in effect they feel the wrath, of Kane
""Here to..here to bring trouble to""（repeat)

Charlamagne you really like Snow
but just didn't make the cut of鈥攚e already had 12.
As it is, it's really hard to fit that many people on one cover already
and have everyone in it get seen.
You know,so...
 We believed in the R&B element and didn't want to take anything away from it
I have been a fan of this young lady for a long time,
 make some noise for Snow, y'all
It's ******* ********
I am no longer competing with these *******, it's a mockery
**** a lane, we're not even in the same race
Couldn't quite put my ******* finger on what's stopping me
Then I lapped them so bad they think we in the same place
I've been moving
You don't want no friction like Newton
**** about to snowball and it ain't gone stop
Y'all gone lose it
This is my court I'm well suited
Ain't no jury left hung
***** you taking that loss
Look, I've been doing me and I've been stacking up
Downplaying what I'm earning now I'm laughing up
Bank statements doing numbers, *****, so now shut up
Watch the lil humble struggle rapper coming up
Cuz all these blogs got y'all broads gassed up
All y'all got no bars, y'all washed up
No Tide, no softener
My rhymes are hot stuff
Snow White just rocked up
Y'all lies and all cut
And every time they do get represented,
it's usually by a female that's trying to sell you her rhymes with ***
 and just a set of just rhyming and instead of just spitting her **** up.
So, I'm gonna bring my lil' homegirl up here.
It's my little homegirl, Snow Tha Product.
Tu quieres hablarle ala gente? You wanna spit a lil' verse for them? Aight...
I been watching ******* come up off of **** that they ain't write themselves
Cuz they done sold what I still have but mine is not for sale
The game's a marathon, ya *****, and only time will tell
Y'all cosign, fly by nights and then watch them fail
I've never been the type to be impressed with none this regular ****
I think the hype around a rapper is a hell of a trip
I think the eyes tell it all and
it's so evident that I'm just so obliged to announced that this game is television
And all y'all fraudulent
That's why you broads in this, salty as condiments
You bothered that I'm back and all of it just like I thought it would
Cuz some of y'all went crazy and some of y'all fell off
Some of y'all ain't **** and some of y'all still fraud
I could've called it back when all these ******* labels got involved
I guess they thought I was like y'all ******* thirsty for a dollar
**** that!
Snow don't fall for no ********
I kept my publishing and sold Woke and the movement
Get no cut
I got Snow Tha Product on the new album, man y'know, on a song called ""So ****.""
People want to see her, y'know, and I hope her label,
 I hope they put out her album, 'cause we put out our people.
If I would've gotten at her the two years my partner,
Travis was like ""You gotta check out Snow"".
I was like ""Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ok"". And I was so busy that I never did,
and when I did, I was like ""Woah"" and it was too late
We're not even in the same race
Game's a marathon, ya *****, and only time will tell
Lapped them so many times they think we're in the same place
I've been moving
Hype around a rapper is a hell of a trip
All y'all fraudulent

18613862,December 4th,https://music.163.com/song?id=18613862,"Sean Carter was born December 4th
Weighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces
He was the last of my 4 children
The only one who didn’t give me any pain when I gave birth to him
And that’s how I knew that he was a special child

They say ""they never really miss you til you dead or you gone""
So on that note i’m leaving after the song
So you ain’t gotta feel no way about Jay so long
Atleast let me tell you why i’m this way， Hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adaness Revees
Who made love under the Siccamore tree
Which makes me
A more sicker emcee my momma would claim
At 10 pounds when I was born I didn’t give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare
I made it from birth and I got here
She knows my purpose wasn’t purpose I ain’t perfect I care
But I feel worthless cause my *****rts wasn’t matchin my gear
Now i’m just scratchin the surface cause what’s burried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school got good grades could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on

Shawn was a very shy child growing up
He was into sports
And a funny story is
At 4 he taught hisself how to ride a bike
A two wheeler at that
Isn’t that special?
But， I noticed a chance in him when me and my hu*****and broke up

Now all the teachers couldn’t reach me
And my momma couldn’t beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me， SO
With that distain in my membrain
Got on my pimp game
***** the world my defense came
Then Dahaven introuced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to cane
I’m a hustler now
My gear is in and i’m in the in crowd
And all the wavey light skinned girls is lovin me now
My self esteem went through the roof man I got my swag
Got a volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly knowin nobody paid Jaz wack ass
I’m geting ahead of myself， by the way， I could rap
That came second to me movin this crack
Gimme a second I swear
I will say about my rap career
Til 96 came *****s i’m here
Good-bye

Shawn use to be in the kitchen
Beating on the table and rapping
And um， until the wee hours of the morning
And then I bought him a boom box
And his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts
But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble

Good-bye to the game all the spoils， the adreneline rush
Your blood boils you in a spot knowing cops could rush
And you in a drop your so easy to touch
No two days are alike
Except the first and fifteenth pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers we don’t sleep we rest one eye up
And the drought to find a man when the well dries up
You learn to work the water without workin thirst til die YUP
And *****s get tied up for product
And little brothers ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got em
And this was the stress I live with til I decided
To try this rap *****t for a livin
I Pray i’m forgiven
For every bad decision I made
Every sister I played
Cause i’m still paranoid to this day
And it’s nobody fault I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose or rather the life that chose me

If you can’t respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you’ll love me when I fade to black

If you can’t respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you’ll love me when I fade to black

My paper ways never fade,
I got 'em from my grand daddy
Old school, so smooth
The type of fresh
that you can comb through
Or you can cut it with a butter knife
And spread it on the brain
of a dame for some change
But that's only if you cut it right
Off top my drop, rims chop,
no cops, drink pop
Lord knows I ain't seen it with my
Green lit, grain grip, bad on my tip
And when she tell me,
lord knows she don't mean it

To a grasshopper

Best friends at your wife's house, tryin to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wantin more
Every day is a test yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin with every breath, I pray to God
that the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothin like tryin to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shakin at the thought that we can make it
I torture me

I'm rollin out on tour today, you gettin sad cause I'm goin away, the...
... chickenheads wanna play with me, you gettin mad cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute some of 'em fine as ****
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be gettin lonely for you
I'm comin home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper thangs in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me, from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
Cause I'm hustlin and makin money, with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin to track me, baby hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop makin money
Cause your attitude's changed and you're actin a little funny
Always complainin, sayin we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hangin up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy baby, call back
Please, ain't nothin left to say to you
Thugs, get lonely too, YOU KNOW


I sit alone in my room drinkin, without a care
Talkin out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man it's on
You're the first face I wanna see, when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touchin every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin sweat on top of you, sink and see
this in yo' head that I'm makin love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax, cause baby right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
Cause everything I'm givin to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, YOU KNOW


Yeah, thug life BAY-BEE!
Steady thuggin
Ay so you remember that next time you sweatin me when I'm on the road baby
Thugs get lonely too, we ain't gotta go through all this bulls*ittin ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me
YOU KNOW

There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some *******t, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
cuz I say so many rhymes,
it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
And I could give a ******* what category you place me
Long as when I'm pu*******ng up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the *******t you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now don't ******* out and try to wimp out, face me
Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I end up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I end up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough

My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong *******t and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
You *******t sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you muther******s
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit *******t, slick *******t, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up

If you **** me over
Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil
Spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's noones fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these ********' hos

I've tried in this department
but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin to start over
I gotta hole in my heart
 I'm some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I won't go on
til you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion everytime\
I hold ya wasn't jokin' when I told ya
Ya take my breathe away
You're a supernova.. And I'm a

I'm a space bound rocketship in your heart spittin morn?
And I aim it right at you
Right at you
250 thousand miles aim a keen eye right at you (?)
And I aim it right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aikes when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
Theres no limit on how far I would go
No boundries no lengths
Why do we say that
until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one and then
once we get em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' but I stumbled onto you mustve been fate
But so much is at stake what the **** does it take
Let's cut to the chase
But a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake

I'm a space bound rocketship in your heart spitting morn?
And I aim it right at you
Right at you
250 thousand miles aim a keen eye right at you (?)
And I aim it right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and 6 months
it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to god
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Up to my knees and I'm bleedin'
I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so **** it
I'm tryin to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezin'
Til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason
I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would do anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me youll think of me everytime
you look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a

I'm a space bound rocketship
in your heart spitting morn?
And I aim it right at you
Right at you
250 thousand miles aim a keen eye right at you (?)

Without you

I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for
All the time you stole from us, woo
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you
That's why it's so funny

Used to be your Romeo, but we were both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope
Would be ****, but
What kind of lens can you go
Pull a Vincent Van Gogh, just to convince a damn hoe
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why, she tryna act out
She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth, twice
Guys, when someone you die for sticks a stick knife in your heart
Do you try more, Another late night inn
She stumbles through my door and lets the daylight in
And all we do is fight more
And I ain't violent
But she's goin' through my drawers to put the K-Y in
I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like cyanides and
Who has probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight, nine men
I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens
***** it's you I tore, not the frame I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's an to ply for
When you date my friends, in order to wipe your ass
When you removed your bowels
When we renewed our vows
This the thanks I get
I'm waitin' for the days
I can hear you say, ""Marshall, what a skank I've been""
And there's a new guy your being replaced by him
Got your tubes tied for him
Got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core
But the pain I'm in, after you I swore
To make the grey skies in
Here comes the rays like wind
You get a pay hike and am I the good guy, or
Do I just play like him and hope that he dumps you
It's like the dream come true, just to scream ""**** you""
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me
And roll them little snakes eyes in
Since you bought the jury,
They'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty,
Even though you know the real me
It can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings,
I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
It can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings,
I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy

It's my life...
My own words I guess...

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?

""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain

She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time
""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine""
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These ******' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn

The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
""You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
""I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going""
But baby wait, ""it's too late Dad, you made the choice
""Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""die Shady"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn

And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain

Spend it on some things that I don’t need because I do enjoy it
Don’t be playin with my feelins baby girl it’s not a toy

If you thought of somethin opposite then go ahead bounce
Never care bout nada go ahead and make me care now
Turn my feelins off and now I’m ready for my close up
Closer closer she be gettin closer

Good to meet ya when you comin over

He wear such little pants
His brother was a champion
But kiki loves to dance
The second man was chuchu
An master of romance
He loved Damsels In Distress but not as much as dance
And then one day it happened
They went off to the world
They went on to a journey
Idolize by the boys and girls
They learn so many lessons
In all of the foreign lands
But no matter where they wandered
They never stopped to dance
One day inside station
In Amsterdam perchance
The men were dancing side by side by a man with crooked glance
They turn to face each other
It was just happened to dance
That these two men would meet that day and do their fateful dance
""WOW, you can really dance""
""WOW, you can really dance""
He went
He went*2
They said we both been dance all this time oh what a coincidance
And then they dance together
Like no one dance before
The diplomat were dancing
They cancelled all of the war(no more)
The whole world cerebrated
Was no more violence
And all because these men cross path
What a coincidance

you show me true friend

you might as well call me up physically
you know, you got me only into extremes
and i can't believe it
and don't know what to think
sometime around it was so love-sick
now it's so sick
cause they ain't doubt love
your hint is apart
and the day between us wasn't enough
and i know
i feel good time's come
i thought they stay, things are done and become word-made

angels came but they left you day
had you slip away
listen now
 burning empty
still this can't be
but even now we're not that happy
hotel motel it's hot in hell free from myself
but now left with no home
i want you to know
i never would have all
figure out that when you came now
it could have been forever
now it does bring me down
 the high now the low up and down we go
put myself too close got burnt night tones
it feels like i'm sinking in the dead sea
don't we care the space inside us so empty
it's like it's over before be gone
this song is over now so was i want

He like, ""Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me.""
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (damn)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me!
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this *******
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (hey)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (ayy)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (nursery)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (facts)
I said on Flex anyone could get it
I ain't know it would be you

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it
Ridin' shotty 'cause I gotta roll this ****
It's a fast road when your idols become your rivals, yeah
Never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm a asshole
*****-ass ************
Oh my god, Ronny

We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Momma's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (****)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (brr)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse
Off of Yelawolf's album, thank you (thank you)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my ******' self, what's happenin'?
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't **** he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my **** without Dre producin' me (ayy)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But ***** I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (shh)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already ****** one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim

I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body
And put some white chalk around it

On a faraway island in a blissful silence
You and I can, you and I can
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love
All we got is a bag in the backseat
And this love we share, not shabby at all
But the fact is we moving too fast
But the thought passed me
When I got lost inside of your eyes
Cliché to say but too true
Picking up dandys
You always wanted a dandy man you did
Not a candy man I don't sugarcoat nothin'
Extra cash come in handy
Good thing we saved up extra
Before we ran away from home
We gotta go
While we lay in diamonds
On a faraway island in a blissful silence
You and I can, you and I can
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love
I know we got our love in the backseat
That's where we met when I told you I can't meet it all
Found out people cause I'm afraid they might say
We have been tryin' take it all
Moving fast but I wanna go faster
Little afraid it'll be a disaster
But I know that I don't wanna crash without you
You're the one that makes me come alive
I never thought it'd come to
Something that was so new
Something that was so true
I can't let it go
You hold no lies
You speak what's on your mind
You speak in different times
You speak in my language, language
The love and the anguish, anguish
Forever and the end, the end
But I don't wanna think about it
Think about it, think about it
Got the money and the time c'mon let's spend it
Don't you pretend we ain't **** without it
World ain't nothin' if we both ain't in it
Holdin' hands so hold my hand
Hold my hand hold my hand hold my hand hold my hand
When we're laying down
It's on a faraway island in a blissful silence
You and I can, you and I can
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love
Holding hands so hold my hand
Hold my hand hold my hand hold my hand hold my hand
Lay in diamonds
Faraway island
Blissful silence
Fall in love
Fall in love
Fall in love

We stay up, no bail outs

And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not

Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out

Now they call me Mrs. Money like I'm married to the mula
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers

Where would they be if I was down at sticks and rocks again?
They only love me 'cause I'm countin' up these knots with them

**** myself, my health be takin L's from left and right
How I let the paper go from motive to a problem?
Good intentions turn to evil lessons, you adopt em
You watch your back, but what's ahead, boy, where you goin
Years will catch you slippin, creep up on you, no notice
**** the past, it's easy to live in when you get frozen
Gas up in my tank, I keep it rollin
Man I miss the days when I didn't have hate in me
Man I miss the days, coolin, nothin ain't phasin me
Miss the days, yeah, I miss the days
Yeah, I miss the days, s**t, I miss the days

You said were a pair
But it's only lies
Cuz i know you don't care

To you i would share
But deep down inside
Girl i know you don't care
How could you care for me
You never cared for me
You just pretend
And it's all in your head
How were there for me
You're never there for me
Nothing would change
Guess im better off dead
It's getting harder to trust
Turning my heart into dust
Girl is it love, is it lust?
Thought we were stronger than stone
You left me alone
Our hope is just starting to rust
You saw me hurting
You watched me get sicker
You thought you were
Helping me out of the river
But really your help
Was a curse to my liver
You were drowing in lies
I was drowing in liquor
Really did you even try?
You.. Didnt even tell me bye
I.. See the truth in your eyes
It's the reason why you never cry
But maybe it's all my fault
And maybe i'm made of salt
Even still, why would i try to call
Cuz i know you don't really at all
You claim that your there
You said were a pair
But it's only lies

Guess im better off dead
I wish i could hug you
Even through all of the pain
And all of the shame, I love you
We know that i'm not a saint
We both are the same
Imperfect through all of our trouble
I don't wanna die with hate between us
What's the point of living life
If love don't lead us
What's the point of being slaved
If god can free us
We just need a lil drop
Of blood from jesus
Yuh
You made me feel lonley with no one around
You left me in silience not even a sound
The past is behind me
I'm putting it down
So can we rebuild
And restart from the ground
Cuz maybe it's all our fault
And everyones made of salt
Even still, i really hope you try call
Cuz maybe we both care after all
You claim that your there

你让我的内心荡漾
展开了想象
被 困在海的中央
很明显已经偏航
我 承认有点紧张
找不到方向
但我向往这种较量
直到你向我投降
杯里 摇晃的Martiny
给你装载爱意的纸飞机
碧蓝的激浪配你的漂亮
转身后仰再投入你的篮筐
你的笑容像往威士忌里加了蜜
Use magic支配了我的注意力
炎炎夏夜不会被细雨浇灭
跳跃在空中继续摇曳
没人能像你一样调动我味蕾
热辣的tango看你流出性感的汗水
红色的裙摆在篝火下显的更匹配
致命的吸引不在乎会变的多狼狈
像是被烈焰灼伤了视线
你的魅力她们无法拿去借鉴
融化了冰川形成了裂变
收录进我的唱片
你让我内心荡漾 babe
这可不是浪荡 babe
危险 是你制造的氛围
Good trap 我还没做好准备
碰巧 经过散发着香味
弹指间眼神的交汇
U know我没有西装革履也是最耀眼的
脱下你的高跟跟我一起去冒险吧
想去哪就去哪何必在乎他人眼色
我心跳的速率是我真心话的检测
One step two steps keeping don’t stop
Don’t talking bullshit 其他不用怕
我们上演现实版的Jack and ruth
我们的 出现 区别 于 大众化
我不是那种只灌你酒的败类
不是那种泡在深夜各种派对
不是那种只能够 给你暧昧
但我愿意为你在此刻买醉
Ay 我的视线怎么始终移不 开
有点不知所措甚至发起 呆
心里翻起浪你怎么还不 来

Forgive me if I ever forget to behave

想要你和我一起忘我地wave 从清晨
晃到了深夜 忘记了时间 快乐的神仙 uh再来一遍

别担心 云霄飞车初体验我都陪你坐
我答应 角色扮演主题线我都跟你做
在此刻 我想对你说 我想对你说

对你不断靠近 是无法抗拒的本性 ay

我味蕾在捕获 你施展的蛊惑
把所有伊甸园神话里说的都给我

当我第一次认定句点就是你的时候
我抱紧你的时候 那时刻
把时间尽我全力铭刻
体温在瞬间融合 记忆在瞬间定格

Tonight is far away, make me wide awake

That is all I gave, no more exit

Looking out the bedroom window I see the grey
Close your eyes pop the track
Dance with me in the rain
All the colors I see is stuck in my veins
Rains drops are hitting hard on the lonely windowpane

Woooooo
Stuck in bed for two
In the corner where the shoes you threw
Woooooo
Laughing way more than he should
Everything is just royal blue

I see it in your eyes
Telling the car is on the runaway
Get away ride picking me up right off the highway
Pulling out the CD and put it right on display
Everything I don’t *  I just break it away
Carefree days that sizzle away on a hot summer plate
Laying on the beach hearts never gonna separate
I know the feeling
I know

忘记着天空烈阳的妒忌
慢慢沉醉在你的瞳孔里
当所有街灯都为我亮起
领略万物后仅存的心动 我没逃避

我想要
我想要
总有起风的清晨
总有灿烂的黄昏
总有流星的夜晚
感到气氛再升温
孤独的尽头是我们都渴望的自由
理性的落寞我都夹在日记本里头
微醺迷醉 灯红酒绿夜空飞行 冰冷窗台 孤独旅人属于天命
琥珀里的时间冻结了逝去的回忆

我就像
我就像
他们说的那样

I say I wanna be
Tryna be
Gotta be
Your love but I
Some Times I had it and
Fight it but
You just get me so high
I just keep trying and I just keep on wondering why
Everything you do is right
No matter how hard I deny
You Been kinda sweet like honey baby
Right here no  there lay down with me
You
Unless my heart was your key
Without you is suffocating
The smile on my face that you gave me
Like no body
I am all yours

In the corner where the shoes you threw
Woo
Laughing way more than he should
Everything is just royal blue

你曾说我该为你写首情歌
很久了我只想了一个轮廓
没来得及陪你看花开花落
提前的我在这里自食其果

我太自私
所有的话题全都是我
我太自私
顾着自己而把你冷落
我太自私
你的感受很少考虑过
我太自私
我只为自己而活

you said that's how I made up
I guess I can change up
when I see you in my dream
I don't wanna wake up
its time to pay up
its time to pay up

天亮
没了电的手机还在枕头边上
躺在床上的我卧室变成了个病房
我像一具尸体但有颗跳动的心脏
期待着手机被来电提示点亮

我告诉过你如果我写情歌会跟别人不一样
我也没有想过会是如此不一样
i was wrong
我不该因为有你的爱就偷懒
我还没有给你做过饭
我们的付出不是等价的交换
我做的可能还没到你的一半
我知道我该为你付出更多
本该兑现所有承诺
该果断时而我在反复斟酌
换来你最后的挣脱

我的记忆打上记号
遇见你我命是真好
这都能够让我找到
我已经无可救药
除了你的味道
我每天睡不着觉
你的身影将我围绕
你我还有很多朋友都没见过
一起喝点酒看你话慢慢变多
或者我们可以一起出谋划策
还有太多成就等待我们解锁
走遍全世界看人生百态
了解可以活得如此精彩
游轮度假漂泊在汪洋大海
在世界中心当我把你拥入怀里
你从没对我发过脾气
虽然也会有人很怕你
我的决定你都会同意
也经常给我一些建议
你想看什么电影都随便
文艺爱情巨作或者烂片
反正我们才是主演
无论多少部都不变
一起吹海风时我感觉时间已经静止
很多的情书要给你夕阳是我信使
甜言蜜语我看来很多是固定公式
你想听没事我可以给你说一辈子
每当我看见你的笑

在乌托邦的我笑不出来躺在雨天里
不要告诉我爱的人上辈子是个仙女
我还能年轻至少我能rap更多几年
她在的感觉像农夫山泉感觉有点甜
一天又一天过去我爱上了喝矿泉水
懂得拒绝并习惯大自然带给我甜美
带你装逼带你飞床边的机票起灰
路过市中心和超市里都会购买一堆
和你在一起目中无人只看前方的路
不在乎过程有多久至少我觉得很酷
她喜欢穿的像个公主手里握着手枪
右腿上纹着十字架铁链缠绕的模样
只是有天使恶魔相互矛盾不停抵抗
有她在我的内心就像上帝存在一样
她笑着说她都能够忍受
想她的每个夜里我会抱紧我的枕头
明天的阳光如期而至也去一起感受
带你去吃遍所有美食拍照不再团购
我已经习惯冰淇淋的第一口要给谁
看着你又白又爽敞开胃口不再减肥
道理和女朋友选女朋友这道理也对
就像是当初听说唱的那种爱的纯粹
我无法自拔陷入思念雨一直下
躺在了沙发上用歌词写下每句实话
我只想拥有同甘共苦最珍惜这女孩
再过几十年都进棺材才想留下精彩

我们都很渴望刺激但生活大多是平淡
都想过的安逸却被冲动搞到凌乱
问题经常出现因为害怕变得敏感
言不由衷狠毒话语时不时让对方心寒
也曾愤怒的甩开彼此手
多少次怀疑能忍多久一直走
我有多反感你的眉头一直皱
就有多么在意你亦师亦友般的启示我
说过受够了
冷静后却感到特别后悔
你也说过你真的受够了
尽管是因为恼怒想要跟我斗嘴
正因为冲突重复、充斥、动怒痛苦过我们才能更加真切体会到爱
明白就算落魄懦弱绝对不能错过因为心若分裂就没有机会倒带 yeah

来个酷的结尾别让他烂俗庸常
月升的王国做个月升的梦
月色的磅礴照亮月色的缝
月升的王国做个月升的梦
月色的磅礴照亮月色的缝
听 你听
海风轻轻拂动着你的心
月光赐予了此刻的生命
We just fall in the love，now around with sea
We just fall in the love～

Wild as a fox who be runnin' with rabies
Wild as that pedo that's scopin'

With ******es whose daddies keep two in the safe
Cry for the kid 'til they're blue in the face
Hop on the jet then I flew out the states
Label the ****** a view of my face
Considered suicide I do that these days
I thought about what I could do with my grave
Google search how to make a grenade
Toggle my aim scribble some names
Took a few breaths blew out some steam
And I sent that *******t out and I blew up the game

Not a price in the world

Chillin' high in the trees with a bundle of whores
And I only come back home for fun
When I'm bored

Ya might be another dead boy on the front page

El's are ready, prepare to run another all nighter
But keep watch for the cops 'cause they rock glocks
Comin' on the block tryin' to rock knots
Pigs be actin' like they bigga than us ****** from da streets
'cause we stalk mad deep when they walk beats

Playin' tough, starin' down da judge with my hand's cuffed
Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear, awww yeah

Got ya noses hangin' ovea da trees
Bring on your sounds kid, drown by my massive
Kill your body boy and take your lover for hostage
Knock knock, maybe not the fourshots empty
On the violator that was sent out to get me
I'm tore up from the floor up and everything's black
But still I'm on point ready to buck, ain't nothin' sweet Jack
Bucktown, I represent it on the love love
Deeply rooted from my Timbs to by **** above
Don't sweat the buldge comin' from my hip
Grip what ya did hit when I let my tool click
Nowhere to run, ambush lurks in the dark

With my Breaddren, a boodah session

It's clear to me
You feel the ****, now I really see
Night falls around the way
Originoo heads come out to play
Puff herb, break day
It's just a regular, everyday state of being I
Mind holds the weight, rhymes free the mind in time
I find reality follows me where I roam
360 degrees back home in...

To Everybody out there
Ya dig
Check it out
Now I ain't tryna be the greatest
I used to hate hip-hop... yup, because the women degraded
But Too Short made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite I stated, though I only recited half
Omittin the word ""*****,"" cursin I wouldn't say it
Me and dog couldn't relate, til a ***** I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learnt it from a song I heard and sorta liked
Yeah, for the icin, glamorized drug dealin was appealin
But the block club kept it from in front of our buildin
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the buildin blocks
For children with leakin ceilings catchin drippins with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's ""It Was Written""
In the mix with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop
My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have *** for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got noooo place to gooo
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it huuurts meee soooul
I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinkin godly, God guard me from the ungodly
But by my 30th watchin of ""Streets is Watchin""
I was back to givin props again and that was botherin
By this uncomfortable as a untouchable touchin you
The theme songs that ****** hustle to seem wrong but these songs was comin true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into and thought
What constitutes a ********** is the pursuit of profit then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seein the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said don't knock it, mind ya business
His business isn't mine and that ***** pimpin got it
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, they cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got noooo place to gooo
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me, turn off my TV
'Cause it huuurts meee soooul
So through the Grim Reaper sickle sharpening
Macintosh marketing
Oil field augering
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation
Islamic martyrdom, precise
Yeah, laser guided targeting
Oil for food, water, and terrorist organization harborin
Sand camouflage army men
CCF sponsorin, world conquerin, telephone monitorin
Louis Vuitton modelin, pornographic actress honorin
String theory ponderin, bullimic vomitin
Catholic priest fondlin, pre-emptive bombin and Osama and no bombin them
They breakin in my car again, deforestation and overloggin and
Hennessy and Hypnotic swallowin, hydroponic coughin and
All the world's ills, sittin on chrome 24-inch wheels, like that
They say I'm infected, this is why I injected
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here

I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it

Another day another rhyme ho
Another day another time zone
Today I woke up feelin' horny so it's only right
I got two ******* playin' on my trumbone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
****** eat em up, and regurgitate me
**** jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
***** please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came ****** can't wait for one of these
I see you *****, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP *****
I'm hot dog, catch up to me *****
Uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was ridin' on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sittin' on the hood of this *****
Like thanks for the view
Waitin' on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that **** gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now ****** showin' off
****** swear they hard but they flowin' soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Gettin' head like a coin toss
Too easy
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

Cause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack
But I ain't speaking about ballin, ballin
Just thinking about brawlin till y'all start bawlin
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changing the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown

Caught 'em wit an uppercut, kicked 'em in his ass
Sent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk!
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!

We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your vain
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo chain

Naughty up in here (That's why I love you baby) 
Time to bring the ruckus with rap 
From the beginning till we're out (That's why I love you baby) 
Introducing Miss Thing Monica 
That's right representing ATL to Illtown (That's why I love you baby) 
Everybody get up out of your seats and fix your body 
For ain't nobody (That's why I love you baby) 
It goes like this! 
You've been more than good to me 
Give me all that I could need 
There's a little thing you do,baby 
Never fight in front of your friends 
Take me ridin' in your Benz 
Spending time, let me know that I'm on your mind,baby 
Because every time I say ""I love you"" it's with a pride 
And every time I say ""I need you"" it's from inside 
Because my heart is forever,the things you do 
You do just for me, that's why I love you baby

Ain't nobody gonna love you like I do

You think your lucky caught a quickie in a nap 
A hickey on your lap 
That's the payback for the scratches you left on my back 
You wouldn't need a toy-friend with a boyfriend 
Or somethin' proper if you slept under the thunder 
Keep my number I heard your next best is now ya next ex 
'Cause in the middle what a best *** ""Hey yo Treach"" 
An' I ain't mad at'cha yet 
What'cha pimp daddy don't know won't hurt him. 
Who loves ya best?

Treat me like your young lady 
Special things you say to me 
Feels so good to be with you my baby 
Doesn't matter what they think 
'Cause I'm gonna be here anyway 
There's no need to feel ashamed because you're on my mind 
And every time I say ""I love you"" it's with a pride 
And every time I say ""I need you"" it's from inside 
Because my heart is forever,the things you do 
You do just for me, that's why I love you baby

You say ya lonely, keep ya head up, honey where ya eyes? 
We can keep it on a low-down-down, I don't go down, I throw down 
He threw your clothes over the Rover,so where you gonna go now? 
Remember when I was like ""Who you?"", now you my boo-boo

Cry in my arms so you cry no more at last 
Feed ya body, I'll drive ya rush Audi

Papa just copped a Mustang
Lookin' at you like it must sting
Sweatin' me and mine, I bet a dollar your nuts stank
Hoppin' on the left coast learnin' new west slang
Naturally better, versus them, it's like flint to a cup of rain bars
I'm on par with Rocky and Clubber Lang posse
Know I'm possibly the best they ever seen
Yeah, I'm possibly the best you ever seen
Young Gu yellin' I should rippity rap more
I'm known to black out, y'all resemble the Oscars
Flow so much I need life guards
Not like Rikers, them some whole new bars
Influenced by many but I'm a whole new star, yeah
There's levels to this but I'm a whole new floor
They talkin' keys to success but I'm a whole new door
Still slippin' through traffic screamin' that the allure?
I'm breakin' the law, was too much to ever ignore
I been exceedin' the limit since I had an Accord
Always had a need for speed before I met that boy
9th Wonder, I spent the summer bumpin' Wuuuu, ***** (Wuuu, *****)
Now they like, ""Wooo, *****!"" (wooo, *****)
Been hearin' you for a few, ***** (for a few, *****)
It's true too many can't **** with ya
Uh, hope you know the realness in that bar
I know some rappers only nice to me as jesters
Who really just afraid 'cause they know I go that hard
Askin' if so-and-so and I are gon' rap together, yeah
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried about it
There's room in this game, it ain't crowded
Aimin' at the top nowadays, y'all worried 'bout Miley Cyrus
That's a tear in my eye that I ain't cried
It's some paths to a milli homie, you ain't tried
I count ten by fives, I'm always halfway there in my mind
It's on you to catch up this time

Dropped out of poo-poo weighin' 6-2 with a loose screw
That the doctor couldn't glue, ooh look mama, she said
This world a game, you crack with two commas
When Tutankhamun was Africana, you were a black diamond
Know too many stars turn to comets
We run from the comics until we subjects to the comics
I'm a hero, don't be stressin' the zeroes and the commas
Lookin' anacondas, know they comin' with apples and oranges
Satan playin' me, I ain't Adam unless we talkin' 'bout bombin'
Over Baghdad, you look bad tryna to spar with me
I'm a lethal weapon, a saber or a razor, Darth Vader, Al Qaeda
Every friend of Jada, that said it all, I'm a midget at labor
Deliverin' babies the size of raiders, opinions were made
Ultimatums got none so don't come lookin' for favors
I'm tired of you fakers, Carolina, but I still rep the Lakers
Westside, Eastside, every side my tithes good with my neighbors
Double back on my sins and pray one day I'm good with my maker
Tomato, tomato don't apply, you better watch what you say to me
Everythin' ain't okay to me, everybody won't cater me
Though I know I'm a child of destiny, fulfillment is up to me
Up to your neck in debt for every bet you threw up against me
Lord listen, forgive me, I ain't got no sympathy flowers
They say it's better to die with pride than to die as a coward
I say some situations call for our pride to be swallowed
So we live to watch payback come in the form of good karma
'Cause you know

Loving you was all I wanna do
My whole life

Please let your brother Busta Rhymes elaborate on this topic a little further
You know the subject of love
Let me get on my Barry White **** real quick

Royal empress queen, damn, I so adore you
There's so many ways to describe this love I've been holdin' for you
I been lookin' for this forever, been searchin' abroad
For that original woman lovin', the nurture to God
The power of your presence speaks even when bein' silent
Universal alignment, I respect your refinement
The focus to blossom this love is my only assignment
I wanna provide and take care of you until we approachin' timing
And when you talk, your words remind me of beautiful speeches
Say to myself, I thank God for these beautiful creatures
Usually deep will be the feelin' every day we meet up
After we ****, I'ma face you and kick my feet up
The way you hot inside is such a beautiful reminder
The type to make me comfortable puttin' my seed inside her
You're such a rider, love how you're such a fighter
And I wish that I could find a way to multiply her
I'll give it to her gentle, then I emulsify her
And when she asks to have it, I smash it and then we both retire
Put your hand up in the air, girl
Let me shine my light up on you earth while you in here, girl
Damn, you got me swingin', girl
What makes it hotter is mami and God's fan, girl
Yeah baby, you special, you're one of one
If the decision's up to us, we ain't never done
Let's get back to the fun

But, I could not solve it (oh my God)

I could not call it

We all know the fate of Assata if Cuba don’t harbor
Nobody know I’m harder on myself than lonely fathers
Watching Mrs. Parker, these days nobody know who authored
Rhymes of rappers on carpets
Nobody know who real or not
Nobody still know who shot Big and Pac, Im bothered
Prayed to our fathers for sins I committed summers
Don’t nobody know how many but we know our days are numbered
Oh my God
Nobody know the true religion
Why nobody know to show respect and mind your business
I know prison business, but nobody know how many innocent in it
Nobody know that cures cancer been made by the chemist
Nobody know the cost of a dollar worth less to em Kendrick
Nobody smart enough would ever say racism ended

That’s 12 years a slave, but I’m on year 23 or 4
Been a lyrical grand wizard like Theodore
I'm on the same wave length the sister Rapsody is on
I love it when she get on her Bahamadia joint

I'm getting older I'm no longer the young pro,
so aint no little kid going to tell me I'm done for
and you aint even worth it to rhyme to
just thought I'd go and leave a little note to remind you
In case you want to
stir the pot up,
cause a little drama
you don't really want to battle
I'll say things you never thought of
and have never seen,
you caught a line and became a fiend
my **** rhyme like amphetamine
you had a dream
the type to make you think you fall through
who you think you are you aint too big to sock two
a kick one
I grab the mic and I spit son
try to share the soul laying low in my system
and say whatever it just don't
matter anymore I know my future is destined
to carry on
there's no baggage thats heavy on
my shoulders are very strong. you know

It's just the same old motif
the heart never safe pretty girls a cold thief
she got away
the way she move make you want to stay
its kind of smooth how she stalk her prey
I walk away
don't blame me if you see me look back though
she fit me to a Texas T
baby was black gold
and from my rap flow
I thought I had her but I guess it didn't matter
she didn't think it was that ****.
Leave the girl with the woe is me
just another slide show in my poetry
picture me rollin in a five hundred
buying roses in the dozen
for the lady I want
won't that be something,
but I'm worried it will never be
too many games be played love,
we use it in a phrase like a spelling bee,
putting her spell on me
hypnotized
was the devil in disguise,
she decided the hell with me.

I hope you get everything you wanted that you chose
I hope that its the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, is pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

Hol' up, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know, my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day. No Kim K, but he bagged yay(Ye)

But when you're getting fast money slow down don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I'll be shinin',they'll be shinin
Get your one shot don't you miss it.
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission

I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before, James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in the sky saying
I hope you learn to make it on your own
If your love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope you get everything you wanted that you chose
I hope that its the realest thing that you ever know

And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man can change the world

But you know ive got to leave from here
(ooh baby) ooh baby I'm sorry
But you know ive got to leave from here
(ooh baby) ooh baby I'm sorry
But you know I've got to leave from here
(ooh baby)
You know I gave up everything I knew to be with you
I said peace to my friends, and my family too
I put all my stuff in storage and I built up the courage
Cause I knew I was missing something inside that you nourished
Road from east to west coast with just under two g's
A suitcase full of clothes and my mpc
Confident I'd figure out something to make ends meet
Between the times we was making love and I was making beats
Bounce for a few hours to go handle some bizz
Couldn't wait to get back just to be with my wizz
Girl you took care of me, I'll always love you for that
But you never really trusted me, so **** you for that
I know I made a few mistakes before I gave you my heart
But once we were together I deserved a fresh start
It was usually after you had too much to drink
That I would hear the insecure and twisted **** that you think
And it hurts to walk away but I can't stand the distrust
So I pack my belongings and I'm catching this bus
Sure I'll see you again, I dont know when it will be
I thought I captured your love but now im setting it free
Its like..
(ooh baby) ooh baby I'm sorry
But you know ive got to leave from here
(ooh baby) ooh baby I'm sorry
But you know ive got to leave from here
(ooh baby) ooh baby I'm sorry
But you know I've got to leave from here
(ooh baby)
You know the story but this time I'll be gone longer than november
The schedule continues all the way untill next december
You wouldn't hold me up we discussed do you remember?
My suitcase full enough I got your poems flushing picture
I'm loyal as a doggie then other *****es sniff up
A call whoa whoa how much for international minutes?
My departure is a given
This life chose me, I can't complain I love how I'm living
But enough when I get back there'll be more luther spending
Might invest in a car but if not I'm still driven
Me and you could have children forever everyday building
I'm in it for the long haul but the music needs my attention
A blessing is what I'm wishing--before--I exit
We've been through thick and thin, this isn't hectic
If you leave Im'a object at your wedding
Love is stronger than pride but it is
Kept on drug intentionally kept on drifting
Don't go she threatened use the ill niner as a ill weapon
Didn't think twice, reached out, grabbed her hand and met her eyes
And let out this sentence
(ooh baby) ooh baby I'm sorry
But you know ive got to leave from here
(ooh baby) ooh baby I'm sorry
But you know ive got to leave from here

A ******* never, ever gonna miss you, girl

Mind and your body gotta equal, girl
How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too
Reality is wisdom, perspective
I like Horus, I don't like whores
Hindsight, oh my, I adore, for the time being, yes, I am yours
Trump, my card, it's the ace of spades
And I hate to go away without getting this money made
But *******s be telling to believe in a reason to act up
******* lose his job, blame it all on some bad luck
Roller coaster, my eyes not open
The cold comes every season, trick
In the summer we smoke hunnids, my fall comes often evil *******t
Just spews from my mind, I get confused all the time
My wall of space is confined, so you better elevate or lose time
Just lose time
Smoking good, looking good

And I think it's Louboutin, too
Say dat, I don't play that
I be acting as if I'm a better man
And my mother to my brother from another
Boy, oh yes you can
From my sisters that keep the *******t right
And my mothers that'll kiss you good night
Forty slugs in my liquor cup
Take a shot and I pick you up
Bang bang from the same gang
Kick rocks if you can't hang
Lil *******, what you saying, mane?
Roll up but these lame hangs
Rolling up was a plane, mane
In the hood, it's all good, made our own Hollywood
Took a picture the system my mental track me like a alien
I combine thoughts with divine course
And exhale exhaust from my skeleton
Tell her I won't appear again
******* that, if I'm going, who will even care again?
Hate to be American, get away from experiments
Cause the truths in the pyramids
Cause we all ******* immigrants
And you're lying through your filaments
Lay back if you drink a bit
And indulge in the ******* *******t
This is real ******* rhetoric
Dissolve all the simple *******t, play a different game
It's too easy to be ignorant
Lay back, think a bit
Smoking good, looking good
Girlfriend, what's the issue, huh?
Got them hooked, take a look
A ******* never, ever gonna miss you, girl
Get it understood, you looking good

How your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
And I think it's Louboutin, too
Boy, I must be dreaming
The way you got me speaking
Hope that I'm not tripping because
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do
One time, one time for my *******s of the Indigo
Two times, two times for my ladies that are not a ho
One time, one time for my *******s of the Indigo
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do
Angel, want me for my peso
Telling other *******s you ain't never gonna wait
So I smash in the Range Rove
Beat beat then I add her to the payroll
Smoke another dub with a cousin and a bro
But I won't say it slow
Missing, representing the people that won't grow
So I carry lethal weapons that beat you through postal
Where the foes go, where we ever gon' go?
To the highest of the Horus eye
******* thoughts I am going 'til there's no reply
Flatline, I get lost 'n bossed
Metal cup passed it first
Never parked the cars
We ain't Boston, *******
Ransom, *******
We're on some now so explain it to me, *******
I don't really know but gold
Boy, I must be dreaming
The way you got me speaking
Hope that I'm not tripping because
All I do is think about you
Now light it up, light it up, you know what to do

Sometimes, sometimes you just know, you just know, that's all
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold onnnn
I've been waitin for this moment for all my life
Hold onnn, hold onnnnnn
The best of y'all ******s remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the ****** from goin' under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other ******s would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I ****** with are real, but hey
Those are your friends
Its just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
****** died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold onnnn
I've been waitin for this moment for all my life
Hold onnn, hold onnnnnn
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an him 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus that you were ******' ground
************ seen the bull************t, but never spoke on it
An I know that deep down you really don't want it
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these mother******' streets at night
Come on!
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold onnnn
I've been waitin for this moment for all my life
Hold onnn, hold onnnnnn
There's a lotta ************t that I let slide, cuz its outta my hands
Lotta ******s I let ride, but its not in my plans
An a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, feedin' them to the morgue
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', errrrrrr
An growlin', shhhhhh, an prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is
What's gonna is what's gonna let ******s know
Why you bad in your house, an they lie up to your spouse
Told her it was suicide, but you an I
Both knew the truth, for we'd never die
Listen ******, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
Cuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold onnnn

在一条喧闹后的街  我望着月亮
忘了是雨还是泪水突然滑过脸上
心喃喃自语  我却又听不见
白天  我总笑容满面
为什么每夜  我总辗转难眠
自律和压抑  到底如何分辨
说要做自己  却不敢对自己正眼
原来孤独  是灯光下  所有人都对我佩服
但月光下 却一直害怕自己退步
你别停下  有个声音催促
但这无尽的赛跑为何追逐
If ain’t nobody stayed with me
那这是演给谁的戏
我看着一路多少人都扑空
到最后  怕自己也没什么不同
也背向了背向了初衷
皎洁的月光  请洁净我
洗净年月泼的墨
熄灭我吞下的烟火
我从小到大  凡事都要做到第一位
再艰难咬着牙  再累我不流一滴泪
我有着强迫症的意志力  天赋不能浪费
我让我家里几个柜子里都放满了奖杯
这世界告诉你  成功要靠自己
什么叫做成功我却不知道定义
我已经变得热可炙手
但优秀还是没有为我带来自由
原来孤独  是感觉自己是那蓝天下的枯树
站在高处  伤口得自己捂住  无处哭诉
虽然我坚强但是我也偶尔无助
每当我祈祷上帝说努力了就好
但面对世界我只感觉自己瘦小
They say when you’re lonely, Hang out with homies
他们不懂  说得容易  但我的Home只有Me
皎洁的月光  请洁净我
洗净年月泼的墨
熄灭我吞下的烟火
对自己说了多少遍  I’m a super woman
我逼着心里面  那渴望爱的小女生
要学会成熟点  有话就说给日记本
终于发现世界再冷  没有我对自己狠
我爸教我恒心能让  铁柱变成针
但一不小心能让  泥足陷很深
我是不是应该换个第三人称
问问自己  其实想过什么样的人生
原来孤独  是想哭却又不想瞩目
是努力融入  但你还  常常感觉自己格格不入
是不想辜负  了期待  你却又感觉束缚
唯一的安抚  是知道世界之大
这一刻和你一样  感到孤独的  无数

再无奈 也只是成功无法避开的附带

被名和利熏陶摆布
衣服都故意少块布 沦为了潮牌奴
卖了灵魂捞财富

不断搅合  成了沼泽
人海里  眼泪注定被掩埋  我独行  因为被推在局外
于是热闹比寂寞难耐  于是灯火越照越苍白

就算蚂蚁再用力爬  不曾被重视吧
从来不被谁过问的问号
该如何面对自己  此刻我只想要
Fly Away  让寂寞的我
Fly Away  往梦里面躲

我越多话欲说  就越显得愚拙
就算此刻的我再狼狈   我勒住自己不再淌泪

也许遇见你是种幸运  分开却是天意
不是不能面对  又不是十八岁
爱过你的年岁  心里至少真的不后悔
也许会不舍会落泪  但得不到也许才珍贵
也许再等等就有人会  比我们匹配
很久很久很久以后
当我抱着别个他的时候
是否我就能够   对你笑着挥手
好久不见的朋友   换个角色  对你问候
谁还记得我们  曾多奋不顾身
失去你的人生  我像一棵树被拔了根
如果只能依赖自己  我只能逼自己更独立
雨再大过了总会天晴  不过时间而已

很久很久很久以后
当我抱着别个他的时候
也许我就能够   对你笑着挥手
也许会释然分手   是个出口
很久很久很久以后
当你牵着别个她的时候
我们这个伤口   也许不再难受
好久不见的朋友   祝福你们  直到永久
只是怕可能  以后爱别人  无法像爱你那么深
但爱到了尽头   哭有什么用  也只能接受
爱情里一切莫须有
很久很久很久以后
时间会把回忆慢慢偷走
此刻承受的痛   会慢慢变得虚构
不过就换了一双   执子之手
很久很久很久以后
你我都各有所爱的时候
我们这个伤口   再也不会难受
好久不见的朋友   如果再见   微笑点头

谁来判断谁能被原谅
谁的话也别说得风凉

狼皮下也许是一只羊  走到末路穷巷
谁不是受了伤  伤口才受感染
谁生活更艰难  谁其实更绝望

都自带着矛盾的征状

把痛的伤的全都忘记

你让我有一点颤抖   又一点感动

突然你像流星划过黑夜
摇晃我的视线   划破我的随缘
突然一抬头你看着我的双眼
让我突然之间   唤醒了所有知觉

突然你像流星划过黑夜
一点一点实现   我从未许过的愿
突然一抬头你看着我的双眼
让我在一瞬间   好像看到了永远

我看到了永远   我看到了永远

穿过了山丘
越过了河流
谁在我身后
是停在树上的斑鸠
穿过了深究
越过了烦忧
谁在我身后
是有你才有的感受


为什么不停 问
为什么都说你不行 笨
为什么总说你不勤 奋
为什么老念在旧情 分
为什么独自一人 为什么情绪低沉
为什么有些事太过于纠结而实际上确实也明明都不值一文
为什么要被拯救 为什么老在等候
为什么我不能追求点别的东西比如食物和水空气以及一个很干净的枕头
为什么会觉得累 为什么生活总被
一些个无聊的繁琐的事物在每天的每天中搞得很被动也搞得很废
为什么老学不会 为什么老觉得会
为什么老觉得你能赢你能行其他人感觉就味道都不是很对
为什么会 为什么醉 为什么为什么谁都不配
为什么这世界最好的东西是免费的拥有着一点不贵

穿过了山丘
越过了河流
谁在我身后
是停在树上的斑鸠
穿过了深究
越过了烦忧
谁在我身后
是有你才有的感受

因为我一路不曾停顿
因为有路人不断提问
因为这命题需要凭证
因为我像是得了强迫症
所以我开始拒绝任何开始
同样的生活同样的该死
不同的是我还是那个孩子
执着地念着属于我的台词
希望你能看到我 看到我
不止阳光下还有角落的我
不止开心地笑 还有哭泣的我
不止发疯地闹 还有安静的我
像是一片叶子掉进北风
像是一切现实落入水中
时间伴随鼓点不停摆动
他不介意让你一切落空
可能我会比你们想象中更加狼狈
依旧用着沉默代替无言以对
可能我会埋没在风沙中失去方位
在我下沉之前大喊可能我会
可能我会 回答你所有的问题
希望你能 寻找到自己的答案
也许不会 回答你所有的问题
因为我和你一样 也深陷在这生活的麻烦

记忆像跳动在脉搏下的痛
把歌词写得含蓄没人猜透
说完的话 放开的手
我学着如何过得那么从容
当我的话已没有谁能懂
就让沉默来掩盖我的所有
你的温柔 ，不再回头
向黑暗中坠落
如飞蛾扑向火
把枷锁都挣脱
让泪水把我淹没
判决我犯的错
原谅我的懦弱
永恒的孤独 就当是你 给我上的锁
当我开始学会戴上了面具
用来躲避那些锋利的言语
生而为人多么残酷的命题
我是应该通往天堂或地狱
一切回忆让它飘散在风中
不用在意谁是毁灭的真凶
如果生命只有短暂一分钟
想把整个世界全部都清空
I don’t even wanna know who’s with me.
They ain’t never got no time to remind me.
I swallow 20 shots like a black sheep
All I know is how to be so crazy
You can never tell me Shang you should let it go
Cuz live or die I don’t wanna know
It’s funny how my life is a black hole
I’m really tired of the damn show

无力的解释为何那天依然开了口
故事里的片段，留在离开以后

---南屋Clean出品---

每次撑不下去对谁说
是谁在悬崖边拉着我
是谁一直爱我 不离开我
是谁把我信念留给我
每一句感谢要对谁说
是谁给我鼓励那么多
谁在台下听我 呐喊给我
只想用这首歌对你说

是谁对我说 过 凡事不要说 破
把责任都往那肩上扛来等待好事多 磨
但时间已经脱落 如今一个人落寞
失魂落魄的行走我还赖着时间蹉 跎
枯燥无味 这条路有进无退
夜深了的万家灯火只除了我都在熟睡
她的电话 到现在我还 没有背会
突然变化 从面对面轮到背对背
一起拍的 照 片 想起她的 笑 脸
来不及的道 歉 我抱歉 别抱怨
剩下 还有 多少 是否 已经 落跑
就算无人问津其实自己也要过的好
把那心里话 和新计划
流经笔下不用再去重新比价
到底我能和谁说日子又要怎么过
该要怎么做 因为思绪闯了祸

每次撑不下去对谁说
是谁在悬崖边拉着我
是谁一直爱我 不离开我
是谁把我信念留给我
每一句感谢要对谁说
是谁给我鼓励那么多
谁在台下听我 呐喊给我
只想用这首歌对你说

内心深处错乱的思绪附着沉沦和变质
要对谁说
再次生活慵懒中自带着合理化或坚持
要对谁说
在躁动中冷漠与热情里躺下
像绑在重症病房插着胃管完全不能讲话
已经长大了
学会骗自己世界多坏
可能是怕了
那带不动愉悦的挫败
开心的时候装作口干舌燥把自己一杯杯的灌
不停折返在两极间分裂自己游到对的岸
看着团队不断扩大
和海啸一起冲锋也一起坐下
这顶峰有多少双手升起后落下
再升起 所有话都留在摇动的闪光灯里
Shot out to 每位垫脚石
把我的冲动磨到现在都变老实
还有远走的她想说什么我就望着天
我养了一只信鸽永远出发在我的肩

每次撑不下去对谁说
是谁在悬崖边拉着我
是谁一直爱我 不离开我
是谁把我信念留给我
每一句感谢要对谁说
是谁给我鼓励那么多
谁在台下听我 呐喊给我
只想用这首歌对你说

自私地自称为孤军
总是把孤独当宿命
目光只看前方 遗失了安全感
拒绝了身旁的舒心
惯性一身防备 早断定要登王位
却忘了是谁在我来时给我一张床睡
没来得及感谢此刻他已经在另一个世界里看我
领我进门认识hiphop 一路用严厉的眼光陪伴我
但我 倔强到阴阳两隔时才说
后来我想起你的时候只能找阿才说（I'm sorry）
从南屋到soulmade 和kedon用心血勾兑
当新人们偶尔在偷睡 只想要再耐心点守卫
Okay 我答应你们尽全力
想要的我会自己拿到 绝不信天意
还真要感谢young nigge hater 不停对着我们叫嚣
不需要假的尊重 你们继续保持空壳的高调
钞票 会有的千万莫心切
只为了每双真诚等待的耳朵做音乐

烦恼对谁说
压力对谁说
痛苦对谁说
心事对谁说
谢意对谁说
爱意对谁说
身边谁陪我
我知道要对谁说

每次撑不下去对谁说
是谁在悬崖边拉着我
是谁一直爱我 不离开我
是谁把我信念留给我
每一句感谢要对谁说
是谁给我鼓励那么多
谁在台下听我 呐喊给我

对失去感觉不舍还是可惜
期待着明天 又藏着几分畏惧
你说你已经慢慢学会狠心
尤其是把感情看的很轻
你说你只有这样才能快乐
那你回答我你此刻为何红了眼睛
过去那些伤口应该怎么样去治理
现在似乎只有钞票能够带来刺激
疲于人际关系 被卷入那些不相干的事里
只有关闭卧室房门以后你才是你自己
孤独是种状态 即便多么勤奋
出现在生活中你眼神某一刻的停顿
是谁在白天笑得开心 为人多么平顺
又是谁在网易云看了一整夜的评论
总说着别为我担心 我们装得顶天立地绝对不会退缩
我们总是说着别为我担心 可是今天为何泪水却打湿了被窝
那些是非对错你难以分清
变得成熟也不再真心
被子把头捂住 喉咙像被堵住
成年人的哭原来没有声音
不得不去告别 这结果早就认得
你知道她不爱你 只是不敢去承认吧
没必要去抱怨 也不用去讨论了
她都说了抱歉 那还有什么好问的
想要把电话线给 都掐断了
又是谁的心脏 碎成稀巴烂了
第二天的清晨 不留一点痕迹
除了垃圾桶里的 酒瓶和易拉罐子
你是为了什么总听一首歌
为了什么歇斯底里 为了什么不想说话 为了什么总听一首歌
为了什么让不喜欢喝酒的你 把酒当水喝
这微信把你我变成游子 浮躁且容易厌倦
沟通只需动动你的手指 连分手都不用见面
谁在私心戒备 把借口挑明
谁痴心绝对 被烈酒扫平
眷眷之心变味 把怨毒表明
明明撕心裂肺 你却又面无表情
希望可以等到那个她的来到
希望每次伸手都能得到怀抱
希望找到一种方式可以让你解脱
希望把过去所有不幸全部埋掉
你今夜为了什么带上耳机
直到路灯全部熄灭还没睡去
对失去感觉不舍还是可惜
期待着明天 又藏着几分畏惧
你说你已经慢慢学会狠心
尤其是把感情看得很轻
你说你只有这样才能快乐
那你回答我你此刻为何红了眼睛
你今夜为了什么带上耳机
即便过去糟糕到不敢去回看
的确感觉不舍还有可惜
但我相信未来有你陪伴
我也尝试学会所谓狠心
却不想让我自己 变得冷冰
愿每一个人都能得到快乐
愿你们今夜可以不再红着眼睛

在这寒风中颤抖
抵抗抑郁的袭击
徘徊现实与梦
诉求着真理 我故作神秘
双眼紧闭
忏悔着自己的过去和人生的不宜 ye
是否感觉到生活的失败
无时无刻对死亡的依赖
你的信仰用胶片去对待
oh〜无法替代
Oh babe u feel me
放下那些本该遗忘的过去
该珍惜 用尽全力

All the around world ,要忠于自我
不要总是,选择去逃避
这一场闹剧,该如何抽离
举步维艰该拉出去枪毙
道路还有,几分曲折
内心又有,几分忐忑
与其站着,不如贯彻
找寻宇宙中最真实的自我
Tell me who i am
问题总是萦绕在这冥冥之中
任何的期盼都来自于这片浩瀚无垠的星空
友情的牵绊
亲人的温暖
都将拯救,这世界末日
带给你的孤单

夜晚的灯光给予信念像是来自天堂信件
洗涤我的灵魂阻止他再继续发生病变
仿佛就要拽回梦里发现不能自已
靠着那至悲至喜来的刺激麻痹自己
躲进市中心的喧嚣寻找存在感
想要躲入人群但是还有天在看
双手合十乞讨
可什么才是我的信仰
上天不能去帮助我那我只能方法另想
对着玄武湖诉我心中的愁
一切优柔寡断随着湖水不停的流
浅水荷花说他从未听过什么孤芳待尽
它说为了新一次的轮回保持随时待命
一山之后山更高
不能没有准备空手接过白刃刀
但是不能辜负身边的人给予我的期望
昨晚梦中看到的人是我自己吗 我希望
我希望,所有发过的誓都一一实现
我希望,不再被困于现实理想之间
没错还是那个孩子根本没有一点成就
但是也没经历什么挫折使我不能承受
生老病死的过程我们迟早会
就算世界末日来了也要排好队
没人会知道这世界何时被粉碎
上一秒的美好下一秒就往下坠
相信我深爱的人还有爱我的人会再
跟我一起存活下去不管挣扎多疲惫
我们都是最坚强的灵魂最坚硬的骨头
我一直都坚信现在问你对不对
每当我们汇聚在一起的时候
那就根本没有任何事物能将我们给击溃
无论什么牛鬼舍身就算撒旦降临人间
地裂天崩也没法把我们给逼退

把赚到的钱拿来带你去环游各地
你想要的也都买给你不用跟我客气
你就照常地美 怎么$exy怎么穿
别管妒忌你的女表子在背地里怎么酸
当然要红酒高脚杯 给服务生掏小费
如果你突然超想飞 那我也不怕药超贵
高消费是你才配得上的标准

目的地要达到 目的也要拿到
我的目的就是跟你在每个城市**
你总是娇媚地笑说我伤风败俗
可下站要去澳门你比我还爱赌
当我们交集不再平行

要到非洲看电影爬到房子顶烂俗地看星星
还要吹泡泡 爱的抱抱

我背负着重同时我也享受尊重
我炫出花式技巧在我一分钟嗡
我的手机还振动要慎重的 turn off my cell phone
快加大你的手机音量
耳朵里掀起波浪带你来到海滩不会夸张
这首歌就循环播放该获奖的说唱让你感受BOMMER的多样

485232780,夜游症,https://music.163.com/song?id=485232780," 疯狂的夜色把他们照的赤裸裸
 每个人心里住着伤感的小恶魔
 无非是聚会 落泪和狂欢
 在我看来都是时间的小手段
 我夜游想去到月球 借由真空的包装下去制造一段噱头
 有可能关乎你我 关乎常态的因果
 关于怎么做 驯服下个心魔
 可能错过了美景因为一路都在颠簸
 跟紧了人潮想看最壮丽的烟火
 于是再来多少人都不嫌多
 身体的碰撞终于让真实被淹没
 是蓝色的黑色的交织着
 是爱过的恨过的消失了
 是想忘却又铭记 想发亮又隐蔽 灵魂早已超支了
 这可悲的21克 食遍烟火也不解饥饿
 你穿梭在繁琐的悲欢离合
 也不会有人想去记得
 疯狂的夜色把他们照的赤裸裸
 每个人心里住着伤感的小恶魔
 无非是聚会 落泪和狂欢
 在我看来都是时间的小手段
 该来的都来了该走的会走
 该埋的都埋了该有的会有
 可能是不经意的一个回眸
 告诉我再也得不到自由
 我静静地伫立已万般小心
 可风吹来吹去我头重脚轻
 就算再卖力出演面无表情
 这卑贱的伤 会疼到要命
 温暖的灯火 编织出生活
 病态的人只在夜游时出没
 四下藏躲 装成一束光
 不善言说 微微在发亮
 人们的声音在天空中回荡
 随孤独的月光在余温里回望
 被淹没的人永远上不了岸
 在夜游的人只能越走越慢
 疯狂的夜色把他们照的赤裸裸
 每个人心里住着伤感的小恶魔
 无非是聚会 落泪和狂欢
 在我看来都是时间的小手段

还不如不见面
还不如不见面
还不如不见面

不见面

什么都没变
还是熟悉的餐厅熟悉的面孔我低头玩到手机都没电
可又什么都在变
曾经手牵手可是现在心照不宣告别时敷衍的说再见
最好是不要再见 我不是矫情做作
就算同个夜店希望也能完美错过
我不想看到你也不想让你看到我
让彼此看到对方新的美好还有龌蹉
关于这段感情我早没了野心
眼睛看着桌上最后一道点心
你的精神面貌实在太过全新
模糊了我记忆里面你哭红的眼睛
陌生的不是这座熟悉的城市
冰冷的不是这些怀旧的文字
离开的不是你 是幼稚的男孩
接受不了挫败总醉到不省人事

不如不见面
早就过期的誓言
因为害怕说抱歉
我假装看不见

这个世上什么东西是永久的
当初握的再紧我还不是松手了
一起买的漱口杯一个人用久了
在一起时养的狗我还是送走了
你说他的心里面会不会难过
是否像我们一样因为误会心寒过
我希望你能积极意思不是说你懒惰
我以为你越强硬就越代表了我软弱
这些话 我自言自语 说到这
曾经犹豫再三也没选择拨号呢
难得见面 我却只能装作我好饿
藕汤一口接着一口冬天喝到热
路是自己选的
虽然坐在一张桌上但你的世界现在是离我挺远的
我也不想去选择
但如果非选一个那我希望以后我们还是不要遇见了

不如不见面
早就过期的誓言
因为害怕说抱歉
我假装看不见
我假装看不见
因为害怕说抱歉
早就过期的誓言
还不如不见面

分手时估计都在想没什么大不了
都以为生活这部电影自己是主角
反正都会硬撑自己行情真的好
可其中真心快乐的时间是真的少
真希望这出荒唐故事从未起头
像当初压着厌烦装作对你乞求
我选择做自己 就算过得再不好
也不会把这当成怀念你的理由

我害怕失去所以选择拿走你的
那些承诺作废sorry对不起了
你早该知道了我全都是骗你的
我根本就没有那么的喜欢你呢
像那句歌词 没有忘不了的人
这个世上只有我这种忘记珍惜的人
要当个争气的人
就看你转身离开虚伪的难过一下之后我就关紧了门

不是看两部电影就能学会攻略的
恋爱到了最后却也无关风月了
那关于什么？我们想要什么？
反应从“好的”变成了质问“你怎么”

真的沒有理由
我夢寐以求
陪你到最後
人生開始就像電影
守得雲開就見月明
設下的陷阱
讓我遇見你
這天氣根本就不像我的預期
已成為過去過程有再多的波曲
多此一舉不會成為問題
而上帝會眷顧我也對月亮證明
回憶的片段早已自動刪除
成長的變換只都是單獨
相處 之間 隔著一面鏡子
波濤 洶湧 把風浪都平止
大笨鐘分秒針行走的軌跡
泛濫起太傷心無數的回憶
與生俱來的權利
我們之間不存秘密
I get the future DO YOU FEEL ME
這條路太難走
失敗中記錄足跡
和成功牽著手
你是天使我是魔鬼

不在乎是曾經擁有
不退後 此時此刻只想牽著你的手
Oh 看見你藏不住的溫柔
No 愛護你是這輩子的陰謀
到時候 別忘記我 我會帶你去到以後
Baby 這是留給你最後的回憶
為你 寫下曾經說不出的歌詞
兌現 承諾最後只見你的背影
I get the future DO YOU FEEL ME
不想最後只剩下自己
問題是我無法再放棄
所以 我已經來不及
錯過太多美好的回憶
I will try my best to be perfect

我会给你怀抱 受不了看到你背影来到
写下我度秒如年难挨的离骚
你是我今生未完成的歌
唱不到结局却又难以割舍
看你侧脸的轮廓 在灯火中隐没
模糊了记忆每个角落

只为等你一句回应

你会发现 你会讶异

谁的肩膀 能够靠过来
谁的未来 有了你的存在

Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions

Don't ever change, keep your essence

Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change

Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that

And listen to a track dedicated to the backs
8 black, wit phatness possessed, yes!
The Shooby-Doo with the E's puffin the bags that Buddha blessed
I like to utilise my scar mental
That's my fundamental, so check the dread-headed individual
From the sidewalks, where the basehead walks
And the hos won't talk unless you're large in New York
So can it be that I am just a Y-O-G
From the (?P-O-L-O the D-R-E-O-U-N-D?), baby
Gets crazy, hectic, so check my method

In your ear

Snakes fickin' all over my grave

Whether you're phony or fake, it's just how you hate
How you gonna knock me in the belly of the beast

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

So don't brink be what was there is now gone
The black suits with the black Ray Bans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence

Against the worst scum of the universe

You know what time, boo-yaow, I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand you know what I'm sayin'
And uhh, throw up that finger
Ayo throw y'all fingers up! Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?
Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up
And the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
The day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin and you lookin good, yes indeed
Got a body like a *** fiend, you're killin me
With your attitude to match right, don't be phony
Cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
(Look here) I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go
Throw up the finger! And all my homies go
Throw them the finger! Ya know what baby it's like
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you needed, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ballin, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was
Give em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you needed, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
A lotta people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin, you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was
Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
You know? They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you
(Everybody, heyy, alright
Heyy, heyyyeah, heyyyayy, ohh)

Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But you always knew that you'll be the one
that work while they all play.
And you, you lay, awake at night and scheme
of all the things that you would change,
but it was just a dream!
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
From Dust.
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
above the best, improve yourself,
your spirit never dies!
Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne above
don't weep for me
Cuz this will be the labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
From Dust.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.

Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Nụ cười ngọt ngào cho ta tan vào phút giây miên man quên hết con đường về (Eh, let me know your name)
Chẳng thể tìm thấy lối về (Eh, let me know your name)
Điệu nhạc hòa quyện trong ánh mắt (money, money, money)
Dẫn lối những bối rối rung động khẽ lên ngôi (và rồi khẽ, và rồi khẽ khẽ)

Chạm nhau mang vô vàn
Đắm đuối vấn vương dâng tràn
Lấp kín chốn nhân gian
Làn gió hoá sắc hương mơ màng
Một giây ngang qua đời
Cất tiếng nói không nên lời
Ấm áp đến trao tay ngàn sao trời
Lòng càng thêm chơi vơi
Dịu êm không gian bừng sáng
Đánh thức muôn hoa mừng
Quấn quít hát ngân nga từng
Chút níu bước chân em dừng
Bao ý thơ tương tư ngẩn ngơ (la la la)
Lưu dấu nơi mê cung đẹp thẫn thờ (oh, oh, oh)

Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
We can smoke a blunt and pop a bottle of wine
Now get yourself together and be ready by nine
'Cause we gon' do some things that'll shatter your spine
Come one, undone, Snoop Dogg, Son Tung
Long Beach is the city that I come from
So if you want some, get some
Better enough take some, take some

Chạm nhau mang vô vàn

Trao đi trao hết đi đừng ngập ngừng che dấu nữa
Quên đi quên hết đi ngại ngùng lại gần thêm chút nữa

Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (nobody else)
All you other ************* get out my business (really)
Only God can judge me now
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the ****
And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Only God can judge me, only God

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God

I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of ****** holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And **** peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million ************* stressin' just like me

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God

Only God can judge me, only God

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live
Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a ***** to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the **** up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a ***** would
Tellin' them ******, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same ************* in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new s**t is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
*****, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' ******s, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player s**t with 4-Tay

Did my time was easy to burst
Probably words don’t carry on
Never talk just have some fun
And all my memories on repeat
Like you telling me I have to leave
I never should brought my home drinks
And **** up too many time in our backseat
Always looks like I just woke up
Always looks like I’v had enough
Medicine is good, yeh, I’m good, what’s up?
Tell me some new what you did like huh?
Always looks like I just woke up
Always looks like I’v had enough
Medicine is good, yeh, I’m good, what’s up?
Yeh, I said I’m good,Yeh~I’m great

感谢所有人
投给我们的票
但这首歌的现场
我没词可以套
所以灵魂继续熬
准备写一个通宵
当我打开了电脑
经历的比赛
又成为我草稿
坐上经济舱
来到这个地方
隔着酒店的窗
望着月亮思故乡
我的年龄
说新不算新
对于新事物
总目不转睛
心里面想怎么拿冠军
让喝彩不再成为
深夜的幻听
我把押韵
比喻成钢琴
而我的忧郁
是否需要张邦迪
保护一些伤
保护一些秘密
等它发酵
揭开后
我写歌送给你
46A我靠窗边坐下
遇见了歌迷
他略显得惊讶
开玩笑吗
Rapper坐在经济舱
面子伤不伤
我说这是
通往成功的方向
结束谈话
沉默在万米高空上
耳机隔音
仿佛身旁空荡荡
安静容易让我想起
自己的妈妈
没想到那是我们
最后一通电话妈妈
每次当我想悼念你在天上
透过窗月光洒下云层的刹那
希望不会因为一粒灰尘而泡汤
那人的希望轻轻飘在经济舱
希望前后排的表情别哭丧
希望我和你之间的距离没阻挡
你的轨迹有没有偏航
你所希望的是否发生在实际上
Ladies and gentlemen

拨不通的电话
遍布星辰的晚上
跟我轻轻唱
就算你在经济舱
拨不通的电话
信号丢失云层上
孩子别紧张
生活不是竞技场
平常心最怕平常中停歇
像块冰
忘了be water(李小龙的哲学)的经验
Homie(伙伴)说你这么拼
当然需要信心
鹰
不可以留恋地平线
这舱位毕竟看不见
窗外的人有求必应
种子发芽前和泥土比拼
直到足以和天空比邻
不可思议的韧性
来自经历
你别不信
一律千篇的夜
那些足印涉过艰险
帮我灭却骄傲惰性
当被压抑沮丧
逼到临界
了解champion的翻译是冠军
Yeah let's begin
心心相印的人
别停止想念
伤口清清创
并着风再次凛冽

留下回声
旅途中
没有闭眼睛睡一觉
黑夜中
像在海上的信号灯

很有礼貌
耳机用光了电池
没有音乐
我又回到了现实
某种情绪再忘不掉
从经济舱
跳上舞台的喧闹

“for my homie
“你现在过得还好吗？”
我曾经有个朋友
他来自另个世界
自从他高中毕业
就开始了他的失业
他家人让他出去工作
他却丧失了斗志
在网吧里打游戏
日以继夜奋战的日子
从开始选择阵营
到部署团队阵型
他付出全部真心
也渴望能受尊敬
最开始父母争吵让他无法专心
他只在虚拟世界里面能够得到一丝关心
每日网吧里面通宵如同醉生梦死
奶奶打扫时扔掉他攻略当成废纸
而他也像堆废纸无所谓被谁对折
反正他如此随和
打开好友搜索贝壳
那是个有点傻傻的人类牧师
贝壳的QQ头像很土是只小白兔子
他们在东泉谷里看雪在纳格兰上盘旋
才以为爱情将至却只温情十三天
贝壳最后回复是
我得去复读考试
隔屏幕拉勾小指
答应不可能会消失
从此便再无消息
这故事戛然而止
他不愿找现实的朋友倾诉
怕变成别人耳屎
另一个世界都在嘲笑他的幼稚
父母却努力安排他和不爱的人结婚生子
他没有能力恋爱在青春洋溢的二十岁
他越加颓废游戏时间增加二十倍
平常的太阳 无常的发光
见惯的明天 昙花般绽放
普通的人儿 难得朝你身边往
平常的见惯的普通的都成为灰色的头像
他渐渐开始变强
坐拥了公会会长
几百人扛在肩上
也总微笑不慌不忙
麦当劳是个职业
挣点卡为个世界
亲人说他是不孝子
是网瘾该被电了
可是他每次上线
心才能够感受炽烈
带兄弟突破每个上限
这才是他的事业
那是08年5月12开荒太阳井的下午
MT突然掉线
便从此没再上线
他解散公会
偶尔也躲起落泪
每行走一段旅程
列表都有人变灰
等来了以为等不那个WLK
也终于等来下定决心的AFK
“我决定试着做个正常的人”
这是他留给我的最后的消息
我知道他的痛苦挣扎
所以我表示同意
也许这些年的奋斗不过是场儿戏
如今也不知道他如不如意
另一个世界能否接纳他的三十而立
他妈妈也许会把他托给百杂店的二姨
在这世界学到的技巧有些不合时宜
也许他会在无意间播放起这张CD
惊讶这字里行间这些故事与他如此如一
圣光给他的勇气是否会离他而去
我在凌晨两点不断的嘟囔自言自语
太多的烦恼无止境地打扰我的思绪
平常的太阳
无常的发光
见惯的明天
昙花般绽放
普通的人儿
难得朝你身边往
平常的见惯的普通的都成为灰色的头像
你会怀念吗
那无数的日夜
从一个世界到另一个世界
信仰的圣光
照耀在地上

母带 杨秋儒
从我成年那天我就想住进上海
因为我家客厅里面有张光盘
一部旅游记录片关于黄浦江畔
关于东方明珠 群众演员表情怪诞
我慢慢走入了自己布的陷阱
我开始相信报纸上的天上掉下馅饼
一张车票带我驶向梦想中的圣地
开始钢筋水泥中维持我的生计
找工作 或者做笔生意
需要人际 否则难出成绩
风吹进 乌鲁木齐路的 卫衣
湿冷的空气 刺骨般的锋利
想过回去
但却满身骨气
表面看似随意
实则背地悲寂
老妈问我归期
Yeah may maybe
四个兄弟挺直背脊上流社会对立
脚下每块砖头
都值她妈1万
一旦带出静安
只能敲碎吃顿泥饭
曾卖过吸管
屋外皆是饥寒
赚的小钱只能给粥加个皮蛋
所以那些EMO rapper别来和我比惨
老子人生 ***满是遗憾
没有好的籍贯
思想极端
眼看爱情腐烂
但却无法阻拦
你们只懂依靠网络避难
微博中你可以是个杀人犯
可以是** 可以没有负担
可以走上神坛 可以彻底输惨
而我尽管走投无路但不一穷二白
手里紧紧攥着股票期待**二台
楼顶整夜施工睡眠都靠耳塞
三平米的隐私被那三夹板给隔开


你是否想过雪花可以飘进被褥的
你是否想过榨菜可以放进微波炉热
你是否见过男人因为一部电影哭了
当一切一个人在承受他还怎么输呢？
不过no way  no way  no way no way know?
当你不是富二代一切就no way no way know ?
除了握紧你的方向盘你no way no way no
Just no way  no way 直到我戴上Ghost face

朋友搞来了赚钱的路子
我没有太多计划只想赚钱买条裤子
我的思想和我做的音乐一样固执
整日戴着耳机或在livehouse mush
念着歌词 念着
一个穷孩子生活在有钱人的城市
尝试用精神去对抗物质
混迹基督教堂 认识每个牧师
没有听过任何乡音
坐在凉亭
街道上飘过是辣椒和香精
没和这女孩有过心心相印
仅有的只是一夜肌肤相亲
垃圾桶捡香槟公园里和老人将军
只要有人荷包镶金我就感到伤心
我受够了不公
受够了不红
受够了宿醉和躺在树丛
受够了木门的蛀虫
你不懂
我受够了做够了一切的一切
却换来的和你们得到的不同
直到我又默默登上榜单的第一
我把演出费给拿去买了英语CD
他们觉得我没**都算是个奇迹
可我没有抑郁
甚至更加屹立
打败自己才是**我的人生意义
所以当我看见现在这些网络黑社会
各位学校公寓是否欠了电费？
你想体验司法 还是我的正当防卫？
音乐只有音乐 见面喝上两杯
没有我的经历 别想抢走我的王位
老子从不睡眠 并且时刻都在防备
不是反派 不是英雄只是为了生活奔波的狗在狂吠

化作飘渺的烟雾让我燃尽一生

在燃烧再环绕他在我指尖缠绕

感应不到你的气息使我愈发焦躁

曾经你是我的全部代表我整个世界

到如今留我一人独自度过每个日夜

无数次的触景生情在夜里哽咽呻吟

渴望与你拢靠 孤单却将我笼罩

So Funny 我想你嘴角忘了怎么扬起

从甜蜜到争执这过程转变他不讲理

还是会想起 我和你之间点滴回忆

她来得缓慢但离开时风行雷厉

回溯过往曾经何时你是我的唯一

再美丽也不属于我没了归期

揉皱的零钞换取能够见到你的车票

在夜里相拥缠绵在街道开心的笑

残缺斑驳的树根旁是街边的路灯

潜行穿梭在世间如今心死难复生

从开始百般憧憬怎料会留下遗憾

原来也只是风景只陪我走过一段

只留下一段的遗憾任由在内心糜烂

尝试将你忘记 可想你成了习惯

再也没有了机会防线被彻底击溃

又换作是谁的怀里现在任你依偎

笔描绘的文墨你憔悴而又沉默

艰难的适应着没有你的生活

依旧在奔波 我却迷失掉了方向

黑夜是衬托 依旧徘徊在路口张望

如同跳进了冰窖 不再靠近的心跳

脑海倒映着画面 却再也没能听到

我好想你 我好想你

但也只能把你深埋回忆里

想让他工作稳定结婚生子，他从未考虑
城市依然忙碌着房东今年涨了房租
空荡的房间一台电脑加上一张床铺
这生活仿佛 改变又从未改变
不停的排练猜想着何时能走上台面
他开始问自己 在这座城市里
有多少认识你的人还依然关心
他坐在餐厅看人来人往
看那些人模人样的人 包裹了多少层
成人世界的直接体现在要凭直觉
他只是觉得没有必要活得那么职业
按部就班过得朝九晚五不难
把青春付完了之后 还会不会有遗憾
现实就是糜烂，它一点都不风趣
它经常会把梦想 转变成工具
往人流中去 有多少人还记得自己

做我的小丑女 迷人的公主

你说你妈妈教育你“做人要活得体面”
她说的没错却剥夺了你所有体验
你像个僵尸般度过了童年
将你囚禁的不是牢狱更像座宫殿
曾经你说要永远做个乖乖女
但这儿的人似乎从来不在意
你的喜怒哀乐都一笔带过
他(她)们管着你却没有真的爱过你
但我喜欢你在腰间的纹身
远胜过她们假扮的纯真
我喜欢和你在酒吧里喝酒一杯接着一杯
直到疲惫的喉咙不能吭声
曾经你天真地以为这世界很自由
可以做你真正想做的事
直到你看清了自己的身份
一个小女孩 和被设计好的人生

让我们超速
在高速公路
让我们报复
这世界带着风度
让我愤怒 让我痛苦
做我的小丑女 迷人的公主

这个世界最爱做的事
就是告诉你“你所有想做的事情都是错的”
在你跌倒后第一时间找到你说
“早跟你讲过了，干嘛还要做呢？”
当你反问道“那我应该怎么做”的时候
他(她)们又会突然变得沉默
接着告诉你
“人活一辈子也就这样了
你不喜欢也得忍着。”
但这都是他(她)们编织的谎言
为了掩盖他(她)们自己的平庸
一辈子都低着头活着
怎么可能看到那灿烂的星空
别丢了你自己的立场
只为了满足他们所谓的优秀
因为你最美丽的地方
就是在他(她)们口中的丑陋

让我们超速
在高速公路
让我们报复
这世界带着风度
让我愤怒 让我痛苦
做我的小丑女 迷人的公主

让我们超速
在高速公路
让我们报复
这世界带着风度
让我愤怒 让我痛苦
做我的小丑女 迷人的公主

无论 无论你怎么选择
都不要让别人来替你做决定
因为到最后 当所有人都走了
承担后果的不还是你吗

就像整个社会被人心笼罩着 它也是黑的
我背着宿命的十字架
也渴望Power, paper and respect
我想这大概就是human nature
佛家说 烦恼即是菩提 我暂且不提
我倒是希望能够回到母体
老妈对不起 我时常把你气得跺脚
你说你后悔当初没有堕胎把我堕掉
每当我放学回家 放下那沉重的背包
家里空无一人 只残留着你香水的味道
那时我知道 你那天晚上又要加班
我打开冰箱 拿出微波炉食品当晚餐
老爸在凌晨两点钟醉醺醺地回家
我从睡梦中醒来 只听到你们在吵架
我没有办法专心面对第二天的考试
老师他不喜欢我 我也不喜欢老师
我讨厌穿制服 我讨厌学校的制度
我讨厌训导主任的嘴脸 讨厌被束缚
That's true
很多人不屑我的态度 他们说我太cool
警察不爽我都曾将我逮捕
I don't give a **** about 人家说什么
他们想说什么就说什么 但是他们算什么
没有谁有权利拿他的标准衡量我
主宰是我自己 随便人家如何想 我还是我
爱钱的女人只给凯子摸
不懂得用保险套的人别嫌孩子多
金钱力量虽大 却生不带来死不带走
紧握着双拳的人们何时能松开手？
Life's a struggle 日子还要过

有多少夜 痛苦烦恼着你无法入睡…
Life's a struggle 日子还要过
品尝喜怒哀乐之后 又是数不尽的troubles
Everyday 有多少问题要去面对
有多少夜 痛苦烦恼着你无法入睡…
法庭严肃的空气逼得我快不能呼吸
当时面临着终生监禁的我开始反省
铁栏杆之后又是个截然不同的景象
刑犯们眼神中看不到一点和平的气象
仅有一寸短的铅笔 写的是监狱风云
日记上描绘的不是美好的户外风景
自由在他们眼里才是憧憬
放一把自制武器在枕头旁 以防随时有人偷袭
有些人怀疑老婆在外偷情
有些人把家人寄来的信件一张一张好好收集
有些人二十四小时几乎在床上休息
有些人精神失常 因为受不了打击
三个月如火如荼的漫长等待已过去
出狱后的我得面对三年的缓刑期
这也好 一生中第一次感觉到幸福
但是生命的考验何止如此我不清楚
我不知道 接下来还有什么会发生
翻开报纸的新闻又是看到放火杀人
还记得某年无意间发现的照片
**************************
这简直摧毁了她在我心目中的形象
我无法忘怀照片中那笑容多么**
我抵抗 胸口存在着不安及惶恐
我不断听到痛苦的声音在内心怒吼

Life's a struggle 日子还要过

有多少夜 痛苦烦恼着你无法入睡…
不论我走到天南 不论我走到地北
不论我走到哪都见识到人心的虚伪
It's kinda funny 在人的眼里只有money
外表好像要帮你 却只是想帮他自己
笑容可掬的脸后面 谁知道是个狼心狗肺
连朋友都能背叛 因为只有名利合他口味
她说她爱你的时候讲的是问心无愧
搞不好她爱的是你身后的荣华富贵
你可曾困惑 在你身旁谁是敌是友
对你落井下石的可能就是你的挚友
你可曾经历 当你最需要帮助的时候
平常跟你称兄道弟的人都突然失踪
亲爱的神 伟大的神
你可以怪我想法太过无知 但我只是人
我不信人 因为人也不信我
不要问我为什么 我最多只能告诉你这就是我
生命像海浪一样有时高有时低
你是否告诉自己坚强渡过各种时期
我从命运的天台放眼却看不到星空
漆黑的天空压在头顶使我不得轻松
在我心中 找不到一个安静的角落
我不能再沉睡下去 良心彷佛在笑我
老爸他只顾己见 希望之火只见熄灭
我接起电话是老爸憔悴的声音
虽没见面却不难想像他当时的神情
刚听完他最近失业的消息
脑海里马上浮现祖母的话 警告我一定要争气
我已经放弃所有哭的理由
因为我早就习惯冷漠活在无情的现实里头
人生要如何起头？改变要如何起手？
当活在泥沼中 要如何才能金盆洗手？

all i'm saying it is,this is bigger than all of us individually
this was started by black music pioneers
where nothing by a microphon
and a turn table and this is why
the world is hip hop
ladies and gentlemen
this is why the world is hip hop
我不想醉 可是今晚我无法入睡
我又贪杯 哪怕又换来一夜宿醉
没有误会 这一切谁都没有不对
那是什么 让我们彼此之间 都变了味
还记得从前 那一段的快乐瞬间
是HIPHOP 让我们亲密无间
在午夜 一起快乐的畅想明天
也不去管这一切是否可以真的实现
被别人嘲笑过 我们都不在乎
经历潮起潮落 我们都能顶住
我不服 努力的结果竟守不住
MY GOD快来帮助我们来走出这段迷途
I gotta keep on moving 但我心仍未睡醒
我回头看这一切 仔细品尝的曾经
许多经过的路人 似乎只是擦身
前一秒的回忆 却再下一秒发生
他们都不停的问 我却不停的等
想知道何时才能打开幸福的门
我握着钥匙 但似乎有点迟疑
深怕旁人的爱戴 吞噬了自己
忘记当初的理想 放弃心中的希望
我找不回将火车往前推的力量
这山洞不见出口 我想要离家出走
现实的防守严密他让我无法出手
这么多日子以来 我学到什么
我学会勇往直前 我学会应该怎么
把烦恼抛在脑后 我向着标竿直跑
那更美好的明天就在下一页我知道
带着梦想飞
就让我们去追
不管累不累 会不会
到底走的对不对
带着梦想飞
都让我们去追
我们的眼泪
不会心碎
可惜岁月把人催
还记得当初追求梦的那股悸动 感动仍存心中是个永远不灭的梦
回头忆起思念总是相伴你我左右 随着时光催促 是否一切感到被动
节拍伴着音符滑入心中 梦想给我勇气拥抱真诚感动
脉搏还在跳动 我心仍只想歌颂 渴望世界注视我们跟着地球转动
物换星移让你感到胳臂有点无力 背起这有点沉重却又值得的梦
或许心中有点灰心感到无法前进 夜的挫败总是让你感到有点泄气
never give up,you need wake up,follow your dream 大步前进 跟我一起wake up
不要低头叹气 只要还能吸气 让勇气进到你的内心come keep head up
我从来不喜欢听意见 他说就等他说
就算错了也要搞音乐 好多人听到过 老熊~MOW
好多人了解背后藏的烦恼 不是因为爱他不可能练习普通话
让更多人能听懂 这里最好最刁 嘴角最爱微笑
这些词还没忘记 收获忘记怎么还没来临
有人提前放弃 我相信潜力和难度比他们大
接下来我们之中出现BIGGIE TUPAC 别奇怪
上下五千年的文化够挖哈 黑的被我染成中国红的头发
通过学习 模仿 创造出来语言 梦想洒落在前方
我在拼 不用好心劝告我 继续吼没结果 能得到快乐
划得戳 我晓得要啥子 不得白活
带着梦想飞
就让我们去追
不管累不累 会不会
到底走的对不对
带着梦想飞
都让我们去追
我们的眼泪
不会心碎
可惜岁月把人催
很多的迷惘 散不走的伤
可惜了自己还是一个人在忙
发霉的梦想 关不上的窗
没消化掉的药物他们还要卷根叶子
curse 我的生活是不是被诅咒了
for wat 为什么我也回不了头了
天天想要发
逃避不走 只能面对它oh
天天为了几个破钱跑东跑西
在这个年代谁会在乎别人为何哭泣
你是最孤寂 没人了解自己
他们把你贬低不一定是坏事因人而异
要尝试忘记自己心里面的愁事
发现房间也慢慢变成了你的囚室
故事到何时结束 周末我还有节目
问题也还没解读 唱完了马上去排毒
我们是否能够将一点时间留给来发闷
SO 我从孤独的孤独或许经历也是一种改变你的从容
可是否又在不停猜测所有画面载着我们受的苦涩
竭力遮住无助 我说 1 2 3 跟着节奏我就高兴忘了我不想醉
随着我们成长 一直不停成长
面对困难我们知道抵抗
SO我 你说过这样去做
我知道你的心一定经过
随着时间成长 一直不停成长
面对希望我们知道飞翔
SO我 你说过这样去做
我知道你的心一定美过
带着梦想飞
就让我们去追
不管累不累 会不会
到底走的对不对
带着梦想飞
都让我们去追
我们的眼泪
不会心碎
可惜岁月把人催
把梦想丢进背包 扮 一位行人
没有指南针 风沙总是扰乱我的行程
在凌晨 喧闹的录音棚没有了欢笑
可说句真的 MY HOMIE 谢谢你们的关照
现在的你们是否已经不在迷茫
心里是不是还有个挂满梦想的地方
也许被伤了臂膀 妥协了自己的立场
可是你得相信 你还有用不尽的力量
SO HERE WE GO再爬起来
LET THEM KONW 你不会轻易从梦想的跑道离开
也许在下个路口 就能看见金黄的太阳
也许再努力 就能嗅到收获的麦香
梦是五彩的糖果 吃过就应该满足
因为你的生活比战争还残酷
总有一天 梦想会带着青春记忆离开
你也只能微笑的SAY GOOD BYE MY LOVE
带着旋律入睡 我总能梦到歌词
起床抄下灵感 却不小心撤落她的被子
这辈子 让我措手不及的还有
爱上把情感折射在五线谱上的这个介质
愿意沉沦在自己的梦里寻找真实的味道
习惯记下酸甜苦辣 我开始迷恋这嗜好
歌声滤掉 所有烦恼只剩下真诚的微笑
你们心里的共鸣是我青春留下的唯一记号
记住这味道 深深一口吸进肺里
吐烟圈 看昨天 它带着我飞离
这喧闹的一切 享受安静的一夜
轻轻拂过夜风我又想起曾经的岁月
为理想冒险一次 有谁敢冒险一试
有人浅尝辄止有人放屁有人依旧坚持
寂寥的夜空压不住厚厚的思念无奈
那些想见的人或事还会不会再回来
带着梦想飞
就让我们去追
不管累不累 会不会
到底走的对不对
带着梦想飞
都让我们去追
我们的眼泪
不会心碎
可惜岁月把人催
凌晨三点半 电脑还没有关
还在键盘上继续梦想的下一段
不是继续耗着 是目标还没到呢
也只能苦笑着身边只有烟雾绕着
我算着 有多少人曾经与我在路上并肩
在一起写下留下记忆中最好的瞬间
当我转过头 他们正慢慢走远
不同的方向 把记忆留在昨天
Just let it flow
and I still flow with my soul
带着翅膀等着 风大起飞的时候
Dream on 最后一个任性的要求
擦去汗水眼泪 接着往下走
这是个故事我太过固执
我固执的布置着我的路子
就算被忽视我付出不止
写古诗留胡子寻找梦的物质
我会继续走 按照梦的弧线
向前继续走 期待它能浮现
五年犹如五天回眼走的路线
一种说不出言语的寂寞凸显
很多人都说放弃吧 忘记吧
我依然的继续长期的 扛起它
为了梦的目的 就会没有顾及
大家都在努力尽管没人会去注意
午夜面对镜子 仿佛时间静止
这路不是径直 是否还能坚持
梦想如何建设 是否不被牵涉
这颜色 变浅色 我该如何选择
带着梦想飞
就让我们去追
不管累不累 会不会
到底走的对不对
带着梦想飞
都让我们去追
我们的眼泪
不会心碎
可惜岁月把人催
夜幕低垂 伴随的疲惫有谁能够体会
当你留着眼泪 伤痛又有谁能抚慰
那苦味 暂且称它为成长的代价
背负的重量 随年纪增长而变大
有那么多不能预测的变化
以为可以一起奋斗的到头来却变卦
听电话 另一端是老朋友的现况
当大家move on除了我 还有谁想实现愿望
还有谁像以前一样 一样把梦想放在心上
一样把恼人现实踩在脚下 不去管它
只想 集中所有的力量 哪怕是一砖一瓦
堆成一面墙 砌成一扇窗 就多一分希望 更坚强
更强壮的阻挡那 风雨交加
挡不住的却是飞逝的时光 像雪上加霜
但一路上雪中送炭的手 不只有一双
只有 坚定相信自己 才能继续迈开步伐
如果我 Rap 不到你心疼 那我会试着闭嘴
如果我 Rap 不到你沸腾 像瓶伤心的汽水
下车的时候 是否还能走进你的心扉
下笔的时候 是否还能够得到你的依偎
这些年因为你的相伴 我挺直了脊椎
我成长了7岁 拥抱着这机会
最大的梦想 是与你站在一起
我们曾经scream **** the world 如今只剩我自己
曾经说过永不轻言放弃的誓言在哪
曾经跟我一起奋斗多年的兄弟你们在哪
会不会是未来来的太快 这让你我害怕
是不是有人会开始放屁 有人会开始放下
从纽约到台北 这路到底有多长
我开始怀念这个没有人去过的地方
Oh my hommie in my heart 你永远都在这
无论如何我走到哪 你永远都会在这
带着梦想飞
就让我们去追
不管累不累 会不会
到底走的对不对
带着梦想飞
都让我们去追
我们的眼泪
不会心碎
可惜岁月把人催
这个旋律如此动人放飞我的思绪
一段段回忆凝结成这里的一字一句
真有趣
突然想回到过去
就让这动人旋律这么一直继续下去
有很多话想说
不知道该对谁说
日子就这么过
不知道该不该执着
我犯了很多错
你不能原谅我
那么多的悲伤失落
不知道何时才能解脱
你会不会忘了我
你会不会开始新的生活
无论如何
请记得我们曾经爱过
我问我自己是否拿定主意
带领HOMIE占领这片土地
OH MAN在夜里 只有香烟陪我呼吸
已经忘了哭泣 想独立
从小到大 不想被人夸却想好好分辨真假
而知道真相的我却不敢面对而害怕
别人告诉我这是成长的代价
承受不住它 你就不是男人会被现实整跨
把眼睛睁大 抛开其他 把音乐当家
把时间抓 有路就往前踏 没后路可退啦
OH I AM BE THE MAN
夜里问自己是否适合这个身份
OH I WILL BE THE MAN
有天你会把我承认

就让我们去追
不管累不累 会不会
到底走的对不对
带着梦想飞
都让我们去追

不会心碎
可惜岁月把人催

不管累不累 会不会
到底走的对不对

打碎四周绝望的高墙 不再低着头
任何灾难都无法摧毁我的意志
那是五千年文明所历练出的气质
从虎门销烟到签订《南京条约》
再到97香港回归政权的交接
中国早已不再是1842年的样子
没有一国的繁荣稳定哪来的两制
下有天路上有天宫不断书写新篇章
仍然肩负着先父们和平的愿望
只有真的强者才懂得理性和谦让
唯独血性能使人本能地泪湿眼眶

每个岗位都是战斗 每代人道远任重
每道伤 每声质疑成就更优秀的我

那些装睡的人总自卑地恶言相对
换个**无所作为的依然会荒废
他们不相信我靠实力拿到了奖杯
在嘲讽声中不负众望跻身世界强队
想得到社会的回报先做出贡献
也要学会微笑和辨别逆耳忠言
生而为人必须有一颗感恩的心
一个大国的崛起必要万众齐心

妈妈曾安慰我说生活会变好的
日夜操劳着 身后也没人能依靠着

每当我提起她内心是多么的骄傲

我也想宣布独立
我握着笔 但是父母亲不肯签订
说我这项条约还没到期
在电视里 或许我是不起眼的明星
在他们的眼里
我只是个长不大的小孩子
多么尴尬的岁月 多么尴尬的日子 多么尴尬
好想改变一切 只是没有银子更没有方法
人生的关卡 我被不停冲刷
到属于这人生棒球场 上场
我和游戏规则一起成长 掌声
伴随嘘声 阳光太强 我的头开始昏
当我倒下的时候 请你不要笑我好不好
古代有陶渊明清高
不为五斗米折腰 但是我向青春借贷款
可是利息太高 利滚利
滚来滚去滚出一堆烦恼
原来我是投手 被自己strike out
23岁的九局下半 转啊转
我把帽子反戴 还在期待逆转
青春像是一场棒球比赛 三人出局
明天还会有新的舞台
就在青春的九局下半 转啊转
我把帽子反戴 还会不会有大逆转
人生是一场棒球比赛 九局打完
还会不会有延长加赛
曾经 我只是球迷
如今在人生棒球场上我也换上新的球衣
是否还算幸运 又度过一个球季
只是下一季 会不会被现实炒鱿鱼
于是我冲刺一垒 盗向二垒 跑过三垒
绕了一圈我又回到本垒
一个新的起点 回头看不到教练的喜悦
反而变脸 暗号 你会不会遵守
不是没有想过 成为现实生活的王牌投手
握着七彩变化球 只是在梦醒之后
变成大马戏团里的一只狗 咬住麦克风还不肯放手
青春的梦 望着遥远的计分板
分数太少 失误太多 裁判 提醒我
这是九局下半 两人出局 满垒 两好三坏
握住手中球棒 听到自己在呐喊
老夫子 全垒打 安打安打全垒打
老夫子 全垒打 安打安打全垒打
23岁的九局下半 转啊转 我把帽子反戴 还在期待逆转
青春像是一场棒球比赛 三人出局
明天还会有新的舞台
就在青春的九局下半 转啊转
我把帽子反戴 还会不会有大逆转
人生是一场棒球比赛 九局打完
还会不会有延长加赛
23岁的九局下半 我应该反省觉悟
还是当它只是一个美丽的错误
或许没有什么屌或不屌 酷不酷
爸爸 妈妈 或许这就是我的路 你一定不相信
你那不长进的孩子正在执行一项不可能的任务
人生的棒球路 上 我的前途
三分老天爷注定 七分靠我自己
投手是你 打者是你 裁判也是你
自己的时候 你是否清醒
是否还记得当时的青春棒球梦
23岁的九局下半 怎么走
给我一只烟 吞云吐雾间
如果所有失误 烦恼 疲累全都能够过往如云烟
浪子回头的路 实在太遥远
棒球 飞向前 转啊转啊转 转啊转啊转
23岁的九局下半 转啊转 我把帽子反戴
还在期待逆转 青春像是一场棒球比赛
三人出局 明天还会有新的舞台
就在青春的九局下半 转啊转 我把帽子反戴
还会不会有大逆转 人生是一场棒球比赛

走向前从不泄气
要切记
我们有黄色的皮肤流着滚烫的血
用亿万个胸膛铸成最坚韧的铁
我们的立场永远坚定不用再来猜了
强大的China 永远都不会被拆了

这条沉睡的巨龙早已苏醒
民族战斗力拉满到五星
五星红旗永远崭新不需要补丁
这是我的祖国十四亿人的母亲
万里山河飞流直下的瀑布
现代化的发展中国人的速度
坚韧永不服输 博大抛开偏见
数以千万亿的先烈鲜血依然鲜艳

万里江山 繁花似锦

千年蹉跎一抹丝绸最美的红色

从古至今往后 踌躇满志成就
华夏儿女砥砺前行凤凰在首龙在右
中国梯 中国魂 中国力 中国门
血脉相承 中国红的中国人

你看那红色的旗帜飘扬的多么优雅
别用我们的宽宏作为你轻视的筹码
三脚猫的功夫别来和  龙的传人比划
不服就先让你尝尝女排姑娘的扣杀

看我们的队伍   有多么的帅气
虽然我们不在意 别在角落里阴阳怪气
我们呼唤和平 也请你收起你跋扈的怪癖
不然你只能签收送去你家的东风快递

让红旗飘扬 让歌声嘹亮
飞奔在路上一如既往
我抬头仰望 天空的苍茫
迎着风的方向

红色的旗帜在你头顶迎风飘过
曾经的娇弱 那时消瘦
回头看历史长河中各种光影交错
最重要是炙热的赤子之心从未消失过

炎黄子孙的血统无需鉴定
当我陷进 那愿景 前进不需要原因
克服困境 不断前行
一转眼祖国母亲到了70岁的年龄

哎 我想要一直守护她
尽管离最终的理想化还有误差
那就再次整装出发 乘风破浪
让China成为全世界都尊重的对象

七十个年头
积累七十年沉淀
气势蔓全球
国人力量的呈现
基石稳千秋
含苞终将会吐蕊
其实没缘由
我爱她深入骨髓

让红旗飘扬 让歌声嘹亮
飞奔在路上一如既往
我抬头仰望 天空的苍茫
迎着风的方向

未曾身在这里的你接受着欺骗与误会
我骄傲自己在中国歌唱从未无家可归
风暴中成长的杂苗终成了傲人月桂
百年离别也未曾阻止97那场约会
我们曾为了实现和平而为之赴命
如今在山巅的我们也渴望雨点下的宁静
落日的天空你是否能看到星星
红花上的并非蝗虫是你没见过的蜻蜓

让红旗飘扬 让歌声嘹亮
飞奔在路上一如既往
我抬头仰望 天空的苍茫
迎着风的方向

让红旗飘扬 让歌声嘹亮
飞奔在路上一如既往
我抬头仰望 天空的苍茫
迎着风的方向

1306507665,再见Hip-Hop,https://music.163.com/song?id=1306507665,"我怕我没有机会 跟你说一声再见
因为也许 就再也见不到你
明天我要离开 熟悉的地方和你
要分离 我眼泪就掉下去
已经准备飞高不留任何遗憾 就算摔跤 还是要背水一战
把我燃烧 生来就注定要起飞 热血注入脊椎 像不死鸟一辉
异乡为异客 的我披星戴月 抑郁和闭塞 成功差点说再见
还好记得 那年夜晚 星空的画面 继续走着 带着爱和 心中的挂念
时间的长河看不到尽头 像只鱼儿游 没办法逆流
树下那些里程碑 没人告诉我 荣归故里时能有几人归
我做这些为了家人和兄弟 为了我的女孩 给我的勇气
十年的青春 我们依然在这 SUP , We young forever！
我会牢牢记住你的脸 我会珍惜你给的思念
这些日子在我心中永远都不会抹去
我不能答应你 我是否会再回来
不回头 不回头的走下去
还是不习惯讲Skr
最死忠的科粉习惯不了詹姆斯穿紫色
我知道 我值得 你等待
只是变化的太快  英雄变战犯
谁都可以审判你 Hip-Hop火了
就别炒那些冷饭  你不犯我 我不犯你
壮志未酬 我继续扯蛋 潇洒走一回 管它最后空折返
不需要谁帮我唱hook
黄金般的韵脚被我藏在老学校的仓库
前仆后继  打开了窗户
这片土地曾经荒芜  恍如隔世
无论怎么努力  却像被框住  仿佛好不得志  潘多拉的盒子  早被我打开
我早就没有退路  没有对手
只有我能将我自己打败
都说不 进 则 退 你看我活的多累
虽然我听不见你莫须有的责备 aya
像你们听不见的每个word play
那world break 你干嘛还在 乎生活费 aya
no falling 也停下脚步
看着每天你们评价的宝物
放弃保护 层 燃烧的炽烈
领悟不改变自己怎么改变世界
那记得带上 你所有的爱 让
自己彻底在 向终点run fast run aya
站在台上 turn the lights on
重逢的每一朵花都在含苞待 放
所以彩蛋也许最卖座
好人有好报还有胜券在握
但即使结果 被人打上马赛克
也照样解锁 因为最初的快乐
我会牢牢记住你的脸
我会珍惜你给的思念
这些日子在我心中永远都不会抹去
我不能答应你
我是否会再回来
不回头 不回头的走下去
我会一直勇敢的走下去

394685,亡命之徒,https://music.163.com/song?id=394685,"听我说 我原来有个梦
跟你高飞远走 跟你一起走到白头
但是我 拥有化为乌有
忘记我们承诺 忘记曾经爱你爱的那么浓
我不能带你走 我犯了大错
必须一个人走 必须扛下所有罪过
必须离开熟悉的街口 请你不要忘记我
这夜里有小雨飘在空中
当我扣扳机的瞬间 灵魂早已卖给魔鬼
可笑的是 我好想求主帮我赎回
赎回我那一丁点的尊严
想起妈妈的脸 对不起这几年
是否有机会再见你一面
妈妈我犯了错 你会原谅我吗?
我已经踏上了末路
别人眼中的亡命之徒 哪里还有我的藏身处?
我的兄弟 离我远去 我还傻呼呼的相信道义
所谓的人性莫非要用血和泪来换取教训
不想再混下去
想说干完这一票就不再撩下去
想着想着我的眼泪就流不停

出发啦 不要问那路在哪?
迎风向前 是唯一的方法
出发啦 不想问那路在哪?
运命哎呀 什么关卡?
当车声隆隆 梦开始阵痛
它卷起了风 重新雕塑每个面孔
夜雾那么浓 开阔也汹涌
有一种预感 路的终点是迷宫

喂 小子 我想我大概明白你的意思
那些发生在你身上的
曾经以不同的面貌 也在我生命里出现过好几次
对此 我并无更高明的解释
只是觉得今天说不定是个合适的日子
我们就各自用舒服的姿势
用擅长的方式 给人生我们的
不管是一种告解还是一份答辩词
人再有本事也难抵抗命运的不仁慈
这道理再简单不过 接不接受是另外一回事
真爱并非不来 它只是被无预警的恶意的延迟
不要让某个女人做的蠢事
变成你自己与自己的争执
为什么 该有的都有还是觉得不够
天呀 该不会是贪心的念头
为什么 拼了命地工作 拼了命地追梦
到头来原地没有动过
为什么 万里晴空下的面孔
庸庸碌碌不开心地锁着眉头 要向谁哭诉
为什么 想去看场电影
该死的台风偏偏选在每一个的周末
为什么 这个世界上 就是有人穷得发疯
有人富有 把钞票当作了枕头
为什么 新闻里 鼻酸故事 只为了
偷面包给妈妈 充饥的小偷
为什么 一百个为什么
变成一千个 一万个 十万个 为什么
为什么 我想破头写不出个鸟 念念念
我为了什么

我们都不在意未来的样子
像是精神病患写的诗 或是烟花绽放的节日
随它去吧 我们都只活一次
呼吸呼吸呼吸 呼 一切曳然而止
真理在荒谬被证实以前 都只是暗室里的装饰
只有眼前亮起来了以后
才有机会彰显它的价值 不是谁能决定的
该漫游还是冲刺
我们都在海里 我觉得我们像沙子
你说的亡命之徒 是不是大概就是这个意思
出发啦 不要问那路在哪(亡命之徒 可会全力以赴)
迎风向前 是唯一的方法(是不是穷途末路 有没有藏身之处)
出发啦 不想问那路在哪(亡命之徒 逃亡要全力以赴)
运命哎啊 什么关卡(喘息在穷途末路 给我个藏身之处)

我知道你的光芒歇息 只為了讓我glow

你不停的促許我 用rap來 push我
告訴我 如何才能促成新的氣象

帶領我們抵擋權貴 用字的巨匠

用十年鍛鍊自己用身體來忍受
要我忍受時間 把一切都帶走
那麼下個十年 還剩什麼在手

我用十年奮鬥 用十年等候
用十年鍛鍊自己用身體來忍受
十年光陰債務 不能判我敗訴
我用青春抵押兌現換來我的態度

那時我最愛看的漫畫來自東立
最愛聽的音樂來自洛城兄弟
在那之前 我生活總是封閉
幾年之後 卻能夠成為風氣
我覺得帥 那種style我崇拜
那種音樂穿著都愛 耳機連上課都戴
""青少年的公害"" 那時大人覺得
但他教我太多事我慢慢聽著 慢慢學著
我學會rap 我學會舞蹈
學會怎麼說唱才好 不被說像數來寶
我學會包容 學會情感怎麼表達
他絕對把我扶好 當我在雨中打滑
十年過去 我還在打轉
我忘了噴漆麥克筆 我忘了滑板
但我make the beat 我放著
我hit the rhyme 我唱著
望著過去現在未來如何幫他發展
他用韻腳走來 我希望他用中文飛
但太多人對他的懷疑是他累贅
""怎麼那麼久的時間還是這幅德性?""
那如果沒人跟著起舞 我們怎麼革命
我多想改變局勢 像他改變我
多想感動多少人 像他一樣感動我
但多少人會排斥 多麼討厭我
當這首成為歷史 這是他留下的線索

我用十年奮鬥 用十年等候
用十年鍛鍊自己用身體來忍受
要我忍受時間 把一切都帶走
那麼下個十年 還剩什麼在手

我用十年奮鬥 用十年等候
用十年鍛鍊自己用身體來忍受
十年光陰債務 不能判我敗訴
我用青春抵押兌現換來我的態度

從Hater變成Gladiator
沙灘尋找貝殼我跪著 當人們睡了的時候我為了
那更美好的明天 我嚮往
十年之後回頭看 我變的更強壯
聽Biggie & 2PAC
這路上我曾不把 中文饒舌當一回事 但現在我們獨霸
Say what you wanna say 滿腹的苦水 我抒發
槍林彈雨的天空 路上坑洞我不怕
踏著許多人開拓的路 看前人栽種的樹
現在換人期待我telling the truth
再多誤解也不講痛 期待的Honor被朗誦
十年前我醉了 我不想醒來在這場夢
Be the best like Kobe,
when i spit, now they know me
有為者亦若是 未來掌控在自己手裡
今天 是昨天的明天 束縛要打破
到底還有多少個十年我們能把握

要我忍受時間 把一切都帶走

老子们从没有醉
只是觉得心很累
讲的话虽然不多
好像句句都不对
活着是冒险我远走天边
岁月过身前又是一年
成长的偏见不止一点点
嘉陵到湘江再走一遍
兄弟塞我包槟榔
分别时话记心上
孤独时候也经常
直到遇到我的新娘
三巡酒还没有上喉
街上继续抽烟烫头
荣华富贵不改初衷
手把手要力争上游

长沙的满哥
雾都的娃哟
喊搞就搞咯
兄弟不啰嗦
我说小伙子千万别狂诶
是英雄就得比个气量
我的兄弟伙计们在街上混
走起来记得孝敬爹娘 切记
那种底层出发
从白手起家
是光荣的感觉
你可能不懂
也可以不屑
但你得去感觉
我干净利落
别想趁火打劫
他们都叫我傻别
他们有的胆大也有的胆小
但从来没人胆怯
你看
没有什么问题 难得到怕
麻烦事每个人逃不了 哼
各自管好自己嘴和包 U heard me
只要给予就会得到
想出类拔萃 直到夜不能寐
为了千杯不倒 先得千杯不醉
不管对或不对 要我谦卑不会
这般如痴如醉 谁能帮我赎罪
人生得意需尽欢
莫使金樽空对月
举杯独饮会心酸
兄弟就在我对面
人生得意需尽欢
莫使金樽空对月
举杯独饮会心酸
哥们就在我对面

那些酒吧呀我也去都不得去

都给我立正稍息
你听到哩东西都是我放出去哩消息
我把帽子正起带
把衣服反起穿
当然谢谢你哩爱
比大海都还要宽
我要跳出三界外
在太空扬起帆
啷个人都非常怪
只有鬼才不会贪

都被背到我哩背
把嘉陵江哩水

我们自信的模样打破你的想象
勇敢站在前方 眺望城市的远方

可没经 过这幕后艰辛的经历
一路走来 迈向成功的舞台
困难总会过去Brother We Gonna Be Alright
I still can feel the duty on my shoulders
I still can see the peak is getting closer
representing the place we resident in
A great city you better check it by yourself
And get related to this plain

近况如何
算来已有十月未见你
甚是思念
此刻我能闻见漫天火药味道
我随军藏身长江边一暗无天日的地窖底
埋首台灯下写这些字却不知把心绪给寄向何地
我爱你
如磐石般坚毅
我问营长我们何时上何班飞机
他总在逃避我的话语
可曾记得你我初次相遇？
你是第一批留洋教师到海宁
我大概知晓西方人所说的天使射中了凡人之心
若没有你我的人生必将难觅知音
你说分离是神的考验我誓必铭记于心
可苍白的文字如何穿透江水踏过泥泞？
我总怕邮差太慢
愿把信件托付给那悠悠长江上翱翔的鱼鹰
此去经年应是良辰美景
母亲可好？
不孝子读书多年徒留个武夫背影
幸得你照顾
也给身处异地之我一丝安定
盼相聚之日
每至寒灯夜雨 怀人倍切 心心念念

我知你此刻已在台湾
彼日知你离去
我亦伤痛极了
但知晓你安全抵达
我亦是快乐的
我踌躇越久
便越难说服自己此生与你恐无缘再相会
也好
如今你我年愈半百
我信你寻得归宿有良人相偎
当今中国格局我是有些难以适应的
但相较乎你我
便是那残冬的时光也是极美好的
写到此处未免有些伤感
人愈到高年就愈加思人睹物啊
我那满满一书架宝物啊
直被我那活泼干女儿称之为封建遗骨
对了 我听闻宝岛常有台风肆虐
你可要照顾自己多些
别天冷不知觉
被风吹跑回我身边
那我可是百般不会放你走的
听人言红尘中蹑足行走
必定会犯一些错事
但我这一生
做对一件事便足是
这件事便是念你至此

我数次提笔再放下
竟不知从何说起
昨日我那干孙扬言要把我之信件写成歌词
我亦是拒绝的
隐私一词在现今社会甚是不可多得
旧时我那兴起参军多是为解饥饿
现今渐渐富裕了我却穿起你织造的旧衣
握起毛笔
爱上了书画研墨
我想时光亦是用来磨的
细细地磨慢慢地磨
总能磨出些许墨香来
即使我鼻子已不灵
眼睛生出疾
侥幸你的照片还能辨出依稀
我果然开始害怕
怕是 我得了老年痴呆
怕把你忘怀
怕是自己孤独地躺了下去身旁皆是些厌我的念白
我那几个没义气老友一个接一个化作了尘埃
还有什么比这更让人肝肠寸断
今夜不如过一回醉生梦死
爱你如初 可千万勿虑啊

嘘
别让他们，看到我在跟你说话，太多缺的
装着学者，却在学着，想要扮演我的角色
校长确认，保安帮我，抓走那些差的学生
gotta get em，穿过了班级的走道，转身，看着你们
那些歌词真实性能相比安徒生
你没有魄力，没有魔力，没有因为，没有所以
新的墨镜我们带起，我的 nike 配着白底
连我香港朋友都问，我的衣服什么牌子
夸着自己衣服潮，但那跟我毫不相干
哥们你的衣服潮，是因为衣服还没晾干
先别想着超过我，你们先学会唱的像我
你是计划我是变化，所以你们赶不上我
你不是 Real deal
你唱的 eww eww
最好先 chill chill
虚心一丢丢
自作着聪明
可哥们你又
不是那一休
你是一羞羞
而我是打口碟 dealer
R.I.P. J dilla
每个丢了，灵魂的 rapper 都以为自己能 make a deal 了
AR 是 killer
Beatbox 接近 skiller
我唱歌走音
但幸亏我认识 Q.luv
三分是 Reggie miller
肚子圆的像是弥勒
我昨天瘦了一丢丢

每当清晨鸽子成群结队飞向天
地下室蜗居的人们走上地面
投递员把报纸塞到门缝里面
物业接到电话上门维修水电
把运动衣汗流浃背只为了几块钱
十几岁的孩子开始四处打工挣钱
坚守的妻子照顾瘫痪的丈夫
中国85%的人买不起房屋
多少个家庭摆放着奖状和遗像
多少个人的故事每天都一样
摇滚青年在舞台上歌唱着理想
我在音乐中又写下了不辉煌的一章
再平凡的人也有一生的希望
 只是他们微小得让你看不到迹象
凡人的歌 是这座城市的气象
凡人的泪 让你感受生命的力量
一张被岁月雕刻的脸
时光无法磨灭
一双坚毅的眼
平凡的生活每天还是那么演
原来你我之间离得还是那么远
一张被岁月雕刻的脸
时光无法磨灭一双坚毅的眼
平凡的生活每天还是那么演
原来你我之间离得还是那么远
几年之前我经常在街边打长途
那是在一家残疾人开的小卖部
他的孩子在学校会不会受到欺负
我只能祝福他们幸福
学会一门手艺 吃上一碗饭
辛苦又没钱的工作你不愿意干
你不愿意干的工作原来那么抢手
年轻人仍然在别人的城市里苦苦的守侯
穷和富都是一天天的过日子
白日梦不敢回过神来面对事实
城市只是一部电影只是没有字幕
我是群众演员只求不发生交通事故
通讯日渐发达 还有谁在写信件
人们都购买了印刷好的对联
跟我感情最深的居然是这支笔
它写下了凡人的生活 也是我自己
一张被岁月雕刻的脸
时光无法磨灭一双坚毅的眼
平凡的生活每天还是那么演

原来你我之间离的还是那么远
一张被岁月雕刻的脸

时光无法磨灭一双坚毅的眼
平凡的生活每天还是那么演
原来你我之间离得还是那么远

真东西不用大费周章去游说
梦里被雷给劈中黄粱一梦

但就这个节骨眼上我没太多时间索性一杆打倒 免得我的专辑跳票 Hold on

留着你的小命等着看你皇宫烂尾
半夜三更不关灯 微弱的光照亮小山村
黄鼠狼在半山腰攀登 看着我们斗地主翻身

你的hot shyt准备被降温
拯救你我 拯救敌人 拯救hiphop的灵童
在牛棚里降生
早就站稳 地下开垦 成为你心中的范本
在这综艺前
早就算准 不怕你玩烂梗
哥们从小拜的关公忠义全
想造风波 结果捅了蜂窝
狗熊的脑袋只想着蜂蜜甜
守着土地 推翻所有阻力
顶起和我身后的兄弟连
不停耕耘 爱恨分明
别拿我和投机取巧的瞎比较
糊弄村民 就你真行
关于真实的问题你能答几道
不再冷静的我要
踩着你升级就像马里奥
摘掉所有花哨的皇冠

新的专辑等待着发售
耳机里传来了De la soul

休息的太少又起俩痘
谈了几个项目没有然后
从不会让步 在一起缠斗
别再把妥协的经验传授
游戏还没有玩够
是我们创造的一切但成果被剽窃
发表着获奖感言
总是在犒劳着屈服的俘虏 到最后
拿走了他的版权
我觉得太多人侮辱着目睹着附属着
不如去做个演员
我想要在他们死之前看一眼提前
给他们送的挽联
虽然尾巴被砍断但我是个壁虎
出生于地下满身的泥土
背后的字母是最佳的替补
只为了能取代在之前的地主
在细数你犯下过的罪状
清洗肮脏已腐烂的内脏
只因为不懂什么叫做退让
所以只能继续和你对抗ay

突然  有把声音係我耳边
陈冠希最近你死去边
好似果个事件
令你冇嗮面 冇嗮钱
睇啲报纸你个样唔多见
人地话你成日係度发癲
咁样落去
好似 好似唔係好掂
到底你係边个
你啲资料係咪错
有无对过有无update过
有咩资格係度阿支阿左
我家阵好Q忙
我嘅助手
sorry你 可唔可以等一等我
喂 又係我
我有一单嘢
你一定唔可以错过
照下你块镜
望下自己
岂有此理 个个人都憎你
你係咪都憎自己
但係我有条出路
劝你重新做起
我地我地成班兄弟姊妹都好欢迎你
我是再造人
每日我自问
发住梦起身
无主嘅孤魂复制人
一个人一直问
谂深一层
一群仆人
虚构一个主人
最后一个罪人
一个暗自悔恨
我是人 放下我一个人 是神
上帝创造人
人塑造神
天地海洋
日月星宿五行
谁创做神
打救世人
谁人杀人
人神共愤
人鬼神 点样分
人人有神
七个魄 三个魂
相信自己灵魂
信咩神都好
千奇唔好信错人
吃力不讨好
上脑 怪力乱神
上述观点偏向精神范畴
现实角度偏向根本源流
万能金钱等同上帝
万恶嘅金钱令人变成奴隶
上帝边个控制
经历清洗再执位
水深火热嘅测试
深不见底
自我控制
冷静分析
总会有计
世界太黑暗
为生命加添色彩
提升本体宇宙能量
发出自我神彩
我是再造人
每日我自问
发住梦起身
无主嘅孤魂复制人
一个人一直问
谂深一层
一群仆人
虚构一个主人
最后一个罪人
一个暗自悔恨
我是人 放下我一个人 是神
事实是神照自己形貌创造了人
定係人看见自己容貌当做有神
神可以化做人
人又如何变做神
谁人手执权棍
结局如何权衡
从观察创造而人推断有神
从观察毁灭从而发现邪神
无神之前并唔见有任何人
无人之前创造神创造神
由几时人开始相信无神
由人代替人群
人群代替人民
人点样可以复製个结局发生
成就别人是人
并唔需要是神
时间是神
权势是神
异性是神
钱币是神
自然是神
人为是神
如果可以由我来再造神
我是再造人
每日我自问
发住梦起身
无主嘅孤魂复制人
一个人一直问
谂深一层
一群仆人
虚构一个主人
最后一个罪人
一个暗自悔恨
我是人 放下我一个人 是神

有时候会散步在一个人的夜里
有时候想你却又不肯打给你
我想给你播放我最近看的电影
呜呜呜呜呜呜

【KungFuPen】
一间房间一张床铺一个座位
一面镜子贴着贴纸镜面快要破碎
一切静止只有时间在偷偷作祟
心里的冬季我需要一件northface
失去的感情不愿再问错对
麻木了反应我早已习惯坐在
一人的房间 冰冷的床边
任凭怎么做也只能坐幸福的旁边
OH MY G.O.D 忘不了she told me
有一天我会飞上天空就像波音747
如今醉倒在房门后的我想问问你
是不是没有星的夜你也只剩自己
习惯关上了门 习惯和自己对话
习惯一个人在这水泥盒子里睡下
遗憾分开时忘了说你走了我会怕
遗憾分开的那么多我开始不说话

有时候会散步在一个人的夜里
有时候想你却又不肯打给你
我想给你播放我最近看的电影

跟着我的影子在三点钟的街头
已经很困 可就是不肯走
坐在请你吃寿司打烊的店门口
呜呜呜呜呜呜
【KungFuPen】
有时我像是得了 孤独症正在流行
比空气更透明 每盏深夜的台灯代表这个症候群
是谁冷落了谁 已无所谓
喜剧一个人看也变无味
整夜都只有那烟雾作陪
打开电话不知和谁说hey
也许世界太大同我的却太冷门
也许该大步向前不在原地等人
也许不是孤独是天生的本能
所以她离开了你只留下了吻痕
还是他离开了你 却在衣柜留下风衣
而在club摇摆的你 内心却很空虚
成人世界很空虚 当你 喝醉等空的
才发现 茫茫世界好像没人能懂你

【KEY】
AM三点还睡不着不如让灯光再暗点
烟雾弥漫 还想在沙发上缠绵
我戏份被删 不再玩角色扮演
让我掉落在城市中的荒岛 收不到我发出的求救信号
my baby girl don't make me cold 在心里头 I miss u so I need you so I need you so

And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Yeah, late nights are the worst for me
They bring out the worst in me
Mind runnin', got me feelin' like it hurts to think
If this is all that I wanted, I don't want it, gotta be more for me
All the core beliefs
And every mornin' I wake up and feel like
I am not worth it 'cause I'm at war with peace
I go to Hell, walk up to the corpse of me
Look at the body like, ""You ain't nothin' but poor and weak""
It's kinda weird
Lately I been feelin' like the only way for me
To get away is if I pour the drink
That's more deceit, more defeat
Is this really what I'm born to be?
That's what you get for thinkin' you're unique
So poor, but I'm so wealthy
Need help, but you can't help me
What else can the world sell me?
Tell me lies, I still buy 'em like they're goin' outta stock
But it's not healthy

They know how to get to me
Suicide thoughts come and go like a guest to me
But I don't wanna die, I just wanna get relief
So don't talk to me like you think I'm so successful
What is success when hope has left you?
I am not a spokesman, I'm a broken record
I'm sick of doin' interviews 'cause I hate myself, agh!
Come across like it's so easy
But I feel like you don't need me
When I feel like you don't need me
Then I feel like you don't see me
And my life has no meaning, drain me
Hands out, tryna ask for love
But when I get it, I just pass it up
Throw it away and think about it later
Diggin' through the trash for drugs
Wish I could give you what you needed, but I can't
I'm scared because
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
I walk through the ashes of my passions
Reminiscin' with the baggage in my casket
Get lost in the questions I can't answer
Can't stand who I am, but it don't matter
We scream to be free, but I stay captured
Knee-deep in defeat of my own actions
Feel weak, but the peace that I keep lacking
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it
But I can't have it
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it
But I can't have it
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help

Sometimes I don't know what this
World has come to it's blowin' up
And this whole country is goin' nuts
And the NRA is in our way
They're responsible for this whole production
They hold the strings to control the puppets

And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin'
And no one's budgin' gun owners' clutchin'
Their loaded weapons
They love their guns more than our children

Shh I think another one just entered in our buildin'
And we'll be
Ashes blowin' in the air

Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold

We're goin' nowhere fast
I feel sorry for this beat sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed

But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast

Anyways for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me

Gusto guts bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of **** I said in jest that's tough to swallow

But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve

Keanu Reeves speed of life avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin' we have no idea
Nowhere to go but hysterical it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this ****
Told you I'd leave my mark on this ***** war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the a**ault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career

But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks forever young
Make time stop will I ever fall off
That day will never come
'Til the pine box ***** **** you
I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed it's already ******
And I'm on top so everyone's just

Spray cans in my backpack and I was starvin'
In middle school with a trey five-seven revolver
My family said I wouldn't make it, now i'm grindin' hard
I dedicated this to the kids growin' up with no father
Believe me I know what you goin' through I almost lost it
Ever seen a teenage boy whose feelin' like robbin'?
That was me at 14, I was driving through compton
On my way to inglewood I was thinkin' of nonsense
Somebody tagging on the wall so I had to go cross it
********** I had guns in my mother's closet
The day she caught me, tear drops started falling
Then she slapped me in the face
Looking brokenhearted
How the **** do I explain that my hood is stronger
Enemies is lookin' for me 2 in the morning
It's been about the 2 weeks and she still ignores me
I'm ******* up so much as hate, that is building towards me
She's on the phone with my fam saying I'm disappointing
Saying I'm disappointing
Oh man, I'm a disappointment
As I sit all alone with pain
I wonder - will I ever see my mother smile?
I wonder - will I ever see my mother smile?
Am I ever gonna see that day
We stop strugglin'
Will I ever see my mother smile?
Strugglin', yea..

Yo, would you like to know why I was so troublesome?
That eviction notice on my door ,ade me hustle drugs
I seen my mother crying
1999
My father left us behind
My feelings empty inside
I try to not miss 'em
Me & my older sister
Carina please tell 'em bout that ****** up christmas
I had to go to school lying to my friends
Pretending I was happy bout some **** I didn't get
Fake smiles through the whole winter
I was cold wearing old clothes and socks with holes in 'em
Gang members I was close with 'em
I was just a kid
They was asking me to do some coke with 'em
I was broke, man I rather sell some **** with 'em
Road trips to the border to go get 'em
Young & hopeless
Trying to get in to show biz
Hoping they would give me a chance
Nobody noticed
As I sit all alone with pain
I wonder - will I ever see my mother smile?
I wonder - will I ever see my mother smile?
Am I ever gonna see that day
We stop strugglin'
Will I ever see my mother smile?
Strugglin', yea..

Oh man, you know what really trips me out is that uh..
People really think I owe them somethin'
You know I hear people talkin' all the time
But its like they don't know the struggle and the **** we gotta go through to get to where we are right now (but I don't owe them a damn thing)
I had to sacrifice so much time, you know
Had to put my family trough so much pain
It's like everything that I got right now, I owe it to the family
Finally my mother can smile now
Oh yeah

Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
****** need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
****** ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You knah'mean?
Where do ****** go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug *****, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and would of tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick ****
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin but peace love
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
for multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
with the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
the deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin but peace love
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sure grown
Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin but peace love
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion

You know how that is, stay down for mine
Outlaw.. look
Now we've been kickin it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We divorced so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin Alize and Cristal, whylin every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change at times
it's only cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you ***** and ho
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home
let's turn this house into a happy home
got a happy home
turn this house into a happy home
Goin through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin and talkin, a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home
live the good life, inside a happy home
turn this house into a happy home
live the good life, inside a happy home
turn this house into a happy home
Happy home
turn this house into a happy home
turn this house into a happy home...home...home...home

They got a *************
Shedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears
Cause *************t was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
*************t is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us *************s on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a ************* is when he's clutching on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same
Cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back

Hoes show me love, *************s give me props
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still prayyyyyy
But on our block we still prayyyyyy...

Now *************t's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bull*************t make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went

In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still prayyyyyy
But on our block we still prayyyyyy...

And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the drive by AK
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
*************t's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a ************* living phat, but held back

Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losing focus... on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still prayyyyyy
But on our block we still prayyyyyy...

And block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
A young ************* learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same mother******s balling
Alcohol will make a lazy ************* slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young *************s understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
Trying to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a ************* change

I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
For all the *************s that I lost to the game... from my block

And I stepped outside
And I was like, Momma, this air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly

I hit that court, and when I jumped, I jumped, I swear I got so high

I touched the net, Mom I touched the net, this is the best day of my life

Air Maxes were next
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffin, the tread, in school
I was so cool
I knew that I couldn't crease ‘em
My friends couldn't afford ‘em
Four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros

Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo

Nike Air Flight, but bad was so ****

And then my friend Carlos' brother got murdered for his fours, whoa

See he just wanted a jump shot, but they wanted a Starter coat though

Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello

You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro

Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground, cause I wanted to be like Mike, right

Wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins
I want to fly
Can you take me far away

Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground

Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down
We want what we can't have, commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it

Got to show ‘em, so exclusive, this that new ****
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes I would never hoop in

Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yea, but I'm part of a movement

My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it, I listened to what that swoosh said

Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease ‘em, just leave ‘em in that box

Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk

That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all

Will I stand for change, or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me, and I'm trying to take mine, off

I want to fly
Can you take me far away
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high

I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

They started out, with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes

Coast to coast shows, he＇s know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He＇s grown farther from home, he＇s no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hose don＇t want him no mo, he＇s cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it＇s old potna, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games' I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this *********in roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin' the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in  the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man' these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie' there's no Mekhi Phifer' this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed' plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot' another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point' I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only *********in option' failure's not
Mom' I love you' but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music' the moment
You own it' you better never let it go
You only get one shot' do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music' the moment
You own it' you better never let it go
You only get one shot' do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

You can do anything you set your mind to' man

17572558,Mockingbird,https://music.163.com/song?id=17572558,"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, aint he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control
over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright

Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But i promise momma's gon' be alright
It's funny

I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown,
it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby, don't you cry

Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But i promise momma's gon' be alright
And if you ask me too

Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't **** with dad （haha）

2416737,I Need a Doctor,https://music.163.com/song?id=2416737,"I’m about to lose my mind
you’ve been gone for so long
I’m running out of time
I need a doctor,call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life
I told the World one day I would pay it back
say it on tape, and lay it, record it
so that one day I could play it back
but I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m saying that
Doubt starting to creep in, everyday it’s just so grey and black
hope, I just need a ray of that
cause no one see’s my vision when I play it for ‘em
they just say it’s wack
they don’t know what **** is
and I don’t know if I was awake or asleep
when I wrote this,
all I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
you picked me up, breeding life in me
I owe my life to you
before the life of me, I don’t see why you don’t see like I do
but it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demon's fighting you, it’s dark.
let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don’t think you realize what you mean to me
not the slightest clue
cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
you gone either wanna fight me when I get off this ******* mic
or you go hug me
but I’m out of option, there‘s nothing else I can do cause…
I’m about to lose my mind
you’ve been gone for so long
I’m running out of time
I need a doctor,call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life
It hurts when I see you struggle
you come to me with ideas
you say there just pieces so I’m puzzled
cause the **** I hear is crazy
but your either getting lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
can’t make a decision you keep questioning yourself
second guessing and it’s almost like your begging for my help
like I’m your leader
your supposed to ******* be my mentor
I can endure no more,
I demand you remember who you are
it was YOU, who believed in me
when everyone was telling you don’t sign me
everyone at the ******* label, lets tell the truth
you risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy
Dre, I’m crying in this booth
you saved my life, now maybe it’s my turn to save yours
but I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
but I ain’t giving up faith and you ain’t giving up on me
get up Dre, I’m dying, I need you, come back for f-ck’s sake
I’m about to lose my mind
you’ve been gone for so long
I’m running out of time
I need a doctor
call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life
bring me back to life
bring me back to life
(I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life)
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
but I still remember the **** like it was just yesterday though
you walked in, yellow jump suit
whole room, cracked jokes
once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
went through friends, some of them I put on
but they just left, they said they was riding to the death
but where the f-ck are they now
now that I need them, I don't see none of them
all I see is Slim
f-ck all you fair-weather friends
all I need is him
******* backstabbers
when the chips were down you just laughed at us
now you bout to feel the ******* wrath of aftermath, faggots
you go see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the f-ck we been?
you can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
little crack a jack beat making wack math,
backwards producers, I'm back bastards
one more CD and then I’m packing up my bags and as I’m leaving
I’ll guarantee they scream Dre don’t leave us like that man cause…
I’m about to lose my mind
you’ve been gone for so long
I’m running out of time
I need a doctor,call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

You on vacation,
We gettin' paid so

We on paycation,
I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do,
it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose

Gunshots in the dark,
one eye closed
And we got it cooking
like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl
with both eye closed
Perfecting my passion,
thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down
so we had to crash it

You used plastic, we 'bout cash,
I see some people ahead
that we gon' pass

I never feared death or dying

I only fear never trying

I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me, now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes,
I'ma go for it,
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

And the same ones that I ride with,
be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with,
if you looking for me
you can find with
In the new car or in the crown whip
My new broad,
that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad,
I'm down with
(and no way around it)
What you say?
tell me what you say
Working hard,
reppin for my dogs,
do this everyday,
Takin off, looking out for all,
makin sure we ball,

Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns,
been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life
and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit,
I'm feelin like a killer inside

Financial outbreak,
I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ride with the plug
so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl
(uh, out fit)
Stuck to the plan, always think that
we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one,
look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody
who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem,
I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed,
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs,
our cars don't even lose control
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes,
I'ma go for it,
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with

Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finding hope in who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know where you been
Where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life

 Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary still balling

 Riding on these niggaz cause they lame

 In a six one Chevy still heavy in this game can you feel me

 Blame it on my momma I'm a thug ni**a

 Up before the sun rise quicker than the drug dealers

 Tell me if it's on ni**a then we first to bomb

 Bust on these b**ch made niggaz hit 'em up west side

 Ain't nobody love me as a broke ni**a

 Finger on the trigger lord forgive me if I smoke niggaz

 I love my females strapped no f**king from the back

 I get my currency in stacks California's where I'm at right

 Passed by while these niggaz wonder by

 I got shot but didn't die let 'em see who's next to try

 Did I cry hell nah ni**a tear I shed

 For all my homies in the pen many peers dead

 Niggaz still balling

 Still balling until I die

 Niggaz still balling

 Never was a thug just infatuated with guns

 Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one

 And got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin'

 Took the image of a thug kept sh*t appealin'

 Willin' to stick out my neck for respect

 If it meant life or death never live to regret what I said

 When you're me people just want to see if it's true

 If it's you what you say in your raps what you do

 So they feel as part of your obligation to fulfill

 When they see you on the streets face to face are you for real

 In confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel

 You're in violation any hesitation'll get you killed

 If you feel it kill it if you conceal it reveal it

 Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets

 Pull it squeeze it till it's empty tempt me push me pussies

 I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

 I'm a soldier these shoulders hold up so much

 They won't budge I'll never fall or fold up

 I'm a soldier even if my collar bone's crush or crumble

 I will never slip or stumble



 I'm a soldier these shoulders hold up so much

 They won't budge I'll never fall or fold up

 I'm a soldier even if my collar bone's crush or crumble

 I will never stumble

 Now everybody wanna see us dead

 Two murdered on the front page shot to death bullets to the head

 Niggaz holla out my name and it's similar to rape

 Motherf**kers know I'm coming so they running to they graves watch

 Swoop down with my ni**a from the Pound

 Cause trick don't give a f**k where you coward niggaz now blast



 Keep pumping ain't worried bout nutting

 Busters thought we was fronting so reload and keep dumping

 I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em

 Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em

 I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence

 I spew it and look how I got you b**ches rockin' to it

 You motherf**kers could never do it like I could do it

 Don't even try it you'll look stupid do not pursue it

 Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest

 I spit the illest sh*t ever been dropped in two inch

 So ticky tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock

 Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock

 Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen

 Motherf**kers know that I'll never be Marshall again

 Full of controversy until I retire my jersey

 Till the fire inside dies and expires at 30

 And lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me

 And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

 These shoulders hold up so much

 They won't budge I'll never fall or fold up

 I'm a soldier even if my collar bone's crush or crumble

 I will never slip or stumble



 I'm a soldier these shoulders hold up so much

 They won't budge I'll never fall or fold up

 I'm a soldier even if my collar bone's crush or crumble

 I will never stumble

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would u still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same ?
All I want is somebody real who don't need much
A gal I know that I can trust
To be here when money low
If I did not have nothing else to give but love
Would that even be enough?
Gal meh need fi know
Now tell me would you really ride for me?
Baby tell me would you die for me?
Would you spend your whole life with me?
Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me would you really cry for me
(would you really cry for me)
Baby don't lie to me
If I didn't have anything
I wanna know would you stick around?
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would u still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same ?
Tell me tell me would you want me?
Tell me tell me would you call me?
If you knew I wasn't ballin'
Cuz I need a gal who's always by my side
Tell me tell me do you need me?
Tell me tell me do you love me?
Or is ya just tryna play me?
Cuz I need a gal to hold me down for life
If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would u still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same ?
If I got locked away

Yeah it's gonna be alright, don't trip baby
It'll get better...
Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to em bet
It's all good, uhh
I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin **** in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
The ********* had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?
The back of the club, sippin Moet, is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin, blunt passin, music blastin
But I just can't quit
Because one of these honies Biggie gots ta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C-notes by the layers, true ****** players
Jump in the Rover and come over
tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree
Never a good day, cause in my hood they
let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all

What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t.
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me
Get up! Thrift shop pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like rocky and Cosby sweater gang nope nope y’all can’t copy
Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
And we did it, our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I’m on.
Let that stage light go and shine on down, got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T **** hustler,
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack,
fat cat, crushing Labels out here,
Now they can’t tell me nothing
We give that to the people,
Spread it across the country
Labels out here,
Now they can’t tell me nothing
We give it to the people,
Spread it across the country
Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful.
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu tang raised you
Y’all can’t stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I’m eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome,
Caesar make you a believer. Now I never ever did it for a throne.
That validation comes from giving it back to the people.
Now sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves
Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us
Like the ceiling can’t hold us
I saw we put our hands up
I saw we put our hands up
Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Ma-ckle-more
And all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Ma-ckle-more
And all my people say

So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you ******* just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, **** this.""
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.""

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

And to think I used to think you was the ****, *****
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, ****
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, *****!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it?
Forget it! You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him
Pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures so long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that **** was rotten
And the way you played him, same **** you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the **** that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
**** it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems, my life is garbage
And I'm 'bout to take it out on you, poof, then I'm gone, voosh

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential; I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that **** back, ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now, wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
*****, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but **** it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the ****
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
Drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!


I also represent anyone on the receiving end
Of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over
Here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of ****
But I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, ""I am your lack of a conscience""
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate
That you became with every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona, is half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions, if there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back, before it fades into black
And it's all over, behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark, uh
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off

willin’ to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death,
never live to regret what I said, when you’re me, people just want to see,
if it’s true, if it’s you, what you say in your rap’s,

1297941,Beautiful,https://music.163.com/song?id=1297941,"Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
Then I'm reaching out for you
I'm just so f****n' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this ****
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit or come to grips with the fact
That I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some s**t's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
I'll be one tough act to follow, one tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at s**t through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get ****ed, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get ****ed, just stay true to you
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no f****n' man-servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at s**t through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get ****ed, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get ****ed, just stay true to you
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bulls**t hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place
Every school I went, I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At eight years old; I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at s**t through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get ****ed, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get ****ed, just stay true to you
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
Then I'm reaching out for you
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful

百米加速一脚拉开我们距离
轮胎摩擦地面是我留下来的气息
极致的代表 塑造最顶级的生活方式
你想像得到 我穿过隧道冷酷的样子
雅痞的瓦罐 根本不用多余的打扮
我的对手在哪里 我从来不关心
跑车音乐这是我们的方式
这样才符合我档次
豪华的装置
等红灯和我相遇 优雅地开启车窗子
我像架战斗机贴着地推进
喷着火别人都变成了背景
听到这引擎声请你当心
没什么能阻挡我们前进
每当我开着奥迪
Im pull up 去找你
我是个绅士很暴力
我从down town 飙到郊区
追不上我  他们感到有点着急
请别耽搁我时间 我赶着要去交易
我的RS4
推背quattro全时都四驱
速度太快车窗外的风景我都看不清
Higherspeed
更高速度俱乐部来漂个移
我的灯一打开其他车都没啥了不起
Think about it
你们要是在红绿灯遇到我们 一定开着辆奥迪

不是我抓不住世界 是它抓不住我
它想我变成怪物 虽然它没说
但就是这种vibe 像个龟壳
想让我低头 让我弯腰
咋个想都可以 就是不准返招
我其实没想啥子 只是不想烦恼
不是非要找啥子 只是不想乱找
不喜欢酒 想醉而已
不是想要听歌 才会戴上耳机
我变得不一样了 不是单纯追求个性
我从不惧怕武力 只是希望世界和平
But I keep falling down
Keep falling down
就像心被捏碎 丢进了大海
没人懂的感觉应该咋摆
播下种子 哪怕不会花开
既然爱都爱了 又怎么会怕爱
你不喜欢我走的路
也请你给我一句祝福
陌生人 陌生的嘴
不管结果咋样 反正过程会美
我想把喜欢的一切
变得不光只是在幻想
付出青春换的不光只是一句赞赏
我不想个人漂泊大海 当自己的船长
看不到希望 只有海雾的白天和晚上
其实做不到 不在乎别个咋个看我
我也是第一次活 当然也会犯错
只是没有你的微笑 我会伤心难过
你的情绪比海浪更容易把我淹没
如果不能陪我远航
就请你不要把负担放在我肩膀
我也不晓得哪种地方叫天堂
有可能是个梦 也可能在前方
But I keep falling down
Keep falling down
就像心被捏碎 丢进了大海
没人懂的感觉应该咋摆
播下种子 哪怕不会花开
既然爱都爱了 又怎么会怕爱
你不喜欢我走的路
也请你给我一句祝福
陌生人 陌生的嘴
不管结果咋样 反正过程会美

这不是电影 后视镜里我像主人公
努力追求成功的人我也不想输给他
今天不能满载而归我就不回家
看朋友在副驾我知道他心里也没底
u know街上总是有些教训可以随时给你
短暂的演出 enjoy the moment
这个part shout out to曾经的我们
夜路太安静 全神贯注不能走神
我们打开皮包计算今天收成
bro thats real money
没有大计划
钱我不在家里拿
破音响放808
take flow like 45
记得说的话  和我兄弟要把蛋糕做的大
我遵守游戏规则  没人保佑阿门
总是有人找你不光只是兄弟
我被命运安排见过不一样的风景
不公平的世界其实非常公平
要想成功就要付出同等价东西
start it from  the bottom  站在俯瞰风景高楼
f to 5o   bitch u can’t get me double
没有瓜葛的人没有办法给我trouble
等下 go to night show   对过去说声句hullo

短暂的演出 enjoy the moment

夜路太安静 全神贯注不能走神
我们打开皮包计算今天收成

real man在雨里 听到呼喊 不会回头
没有思考 过 未来 没有灵魂的废物
不想当他们 现在我有最强的队伍
i got no plan 在我最低谷的时候看他们都显得fake
就连我父母也让我放弃一切找工作必须要对口
整个世界正在褪色
我付不起高昂的paper
能给我自己找的理由
就是没人能当我的对手
手是脏的  必须要金盆来洗
北门上穿梭在贫富巷里
看人们都套着虚伪的皮
最危险的不是他们头顶上的
而是他们一代把一代往欲望里push
i got no way to up
他说don’t think too much
把赚的钱放进鞋盒里整个暑假
runaway 快点runaway 别当个窝囊废
那些没开始 就想着 退出 的人 只会张着嘴
他把我当成一个混混
他把我骗的身无分文
现在他疯了 他对我的奉承
因为我不一样的身份 现在
出现在高档场合 我一样thirty
长大一岁1031 lets get party
风 在我脸上破碎
对我你不是真的了解
我不再关心谁的脸色
我只想走向我的远方
我不再关心谁的脸色
我只想走向我的远方
run city run town by myself
鬼事情get the way by my self
人民币diamond china by my self
lilshin rap star by my self
all by myself dawg
那么多pain找过我们
没事我不想出门
他们才不在乎你背后有过的遭遇
到底由什么组成
现在我背负着家人的hope 被城市闪耀的灯光淹没
留下我曾经也犯过的错 还有想联络我绝情的hoes
一个人永远都没办法完成的game
幸运的我拥有着最强的gang
too much pain
在我的歌词里面
攻占下新大陆的拿破仑
10年来还是同样一伙人
没有听错
14年就说过能代表中国说唱的头等
口哨 伴随 微风
不赚钱 我会 难受
i don’t care 那些虚伪的
把自己  说的欠揍
with my home boy在party 又吹干 了 烈酒
想占便宜的 asshole
甚至不会 跟你点头
god damn
在我的旁边
901泛黄的照片
兄弟们不断的转变
霸占了各大的版面
shout out to 这些年失去的自由
shout out to 为冲动折断的右手
shout out to 担心受怕
但现在舞台下成千上万的人嘶吼
身边总是在变
我不想配合着大环境演
以前的录音棚看不到天
我和我兄弟们没有抱怨
我需要做的事只有一件
告诉他我可以独当一面
就算我失落过那时我醒来后也同样期待着没有明天
right now  在长征  we faster 为homie 为家人
不可能  再重复  那噩梦
打开 了房门 还是一 样的 他们

孟子让我回来给他带份外卖
电话响了绝对有问题才找你
北门上的娃娃永远不会消停

九眼桥的演出好像出了问题

要把世界装进bag   不要劝我回头看
想起接到电话建坤又把别个堵了
可能又是哪个没听过的组合

它需要找东西点缀

一次性就能够让我吃饱

其实只是感冒 算咯
没人盖被子 还要担心老王
上次什么时候有人造访  搞忘
好多化妆品 他们就摆在家里
早就枯萎了那些花还放在花瓶
出去玩还想抓我把柄
不敢相信
thats f s**t
不在乎你吃了什么
垃圾食品可以把你变成一个秤砣
那么多的漂亮女孩只有你能吻我
闯进我的生活却让我受尽了折磨
养了只狗  他能陪我  过一个birthday
生日礼物 假装开心   来一个facetime
牵你的手 快要发霉   折一根树枝来
什么时候 才是个头   感觉人生失败

i told u 这辈子 我最受不了异地恋
我想不通隔了几千公里还能么么哒
么么哒

我只能回到家拥抱着空气
喝一点威士忌来补充动力
菜刀很锋利  我用它劈开了番茄
就当作发泄
隔壁的小姐姐call me
正直的我当然也不会同意
这首歌会一直陪我到morning

为了成功放弃太多的陪伴
家像灯塔让我遥望着对岸
钻石跟项链能感动你
我不是有钱的坏东西
douchebags also need mercy
当受够了一人对抗全世界
低调但总有人想把我怪罪
坚强后的人们都不相信眼泪
挤爆的live house 燃烧Friday
all came for me
all came for me
i lose some body i meet some body
must be more focus
从不爱说多累
听到了熟悉的问候声在挂完电话后还能够大胆的往前走因为我知道就算我失败了也有人能在我背后
到了一切结束的时候
把我的gold chain挂在前面
那些bullshit让他let it go
yah yah yah I’m back home
就算伤痕累累也要back home
就算翻山越岭也要back home
就算听到最受不了的唠叨无所谓
歌里唱的那些炫耀我怕太老掉牙
偷偷的告诉你我楼下给你停辆宝马

no doubt
我知道光阴似箭
有时我也会失眠
想念着家里的便饭
面对着更多的camera
准备着下一场战斗
夜里面播放的伴奏
照应着墙壁的斑驳
go home
一句吃饭没有
她在告诉我life is beautiful

漂泊的我不再在乎如何烧香拜佛
只想有个家有个她能take me back
家会在乎不论我在成都或是外国
我会保护好我自己一直没意外
永远不会忘记我的屋檐我的外婆
即使简陋但有重要的回忆在 yeq
就算我又犯错爱人又在不停怪我
也会报平安在停下的每一站
有太多的丑陋make me wanna diss
家人用她们的拥抱让我放下帮我let go
忍让我已受够开始对谁都是鄙视
自誉优秀对着我瞧不上的rapper疯狂摆手
上头的时候只有他们泼冷水
对我说比这高的山后面真的还有
当我遇到trap 他们不会站在对面
宁愿自己进来期盼我能安全让我快走
当我hustle她会放手回头检查我的伤
当我燃烧自己家人不会质疑我的光
愿意给我一切所有体贴不给自己留底牌
即使我一无是处仍然对我有期待
抱歉 曾经挂断你的电话
我想快点录完这首然后早一点回家
站在风口浪尖欲望想把我推下悬崖
给我翅膀是你的话  别被失望给糟践踏

就算伤了累了也要back home
就算翻山越岭也要back home

 I really hope they held you down
 I really hope it was no lying
 'Cause when heart breaks it feel like the world's gone
 But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion
 And you'd finally let bygones be bygones
 Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying
 You just gotta learn to live and love on

 Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see

 Feel all of the good and bad vibrations all around
 All around us, they surround us
 Was a lost cause with some lost love
 It ain't my fault, pain chose us
 Then I found her
 My whole world turned upside down, uh
 But for the better

 You put the light in my eyes when I'm around you
 I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
 Don't wanna be here alone
 And I thank God I finally found you
 I'll put the light in your eyes if I'm allowed to
 I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
 Don't let me be here alone

可爱的芭比
我带你去世界旅游
可是你竟然都还嫌不够
换一个平行宇宙
最后的一站也必须是家里
只想跟你走My baby牵着我的手
只要你回头一个眼神就足够 skr skr
扯着你衣袖马路领着走 I'm cute devil you know
温柔世界只想你的怪兽
手机有几十条未读的消息我只在意你
听说你喜欢爵士曲怎么办我只喜欢你
学了新的歌想给你听 you get  my galaxy
只想去有你的目的地 My Baby
我为你写的melody
为你保存到下世纪
You can be my fantasy 与你一起飞行
其实我知道你很在意
单曲循环在你手机
询问我歌词的意义 just u u u

在这路口赖着还不肯走
到底还要怎么付出才够
才有以后
也许没办法围绕你左右
就算人群再多也拉住你手
幻想的触手可及的宇宙
都坠落倒头
我是爱你的
想你的话都丢进了海底
原来我拥有的都只是不切实际的虚拟
我还在等雨停
畏手畏脚全部都因为你
好像我随时都可以被任何人用来代替

猜不透你的心像着了迷
你的手像刀尖锋利至极
刺进我怀里失去了防御
我屏住呼吸
我心甘情愿被摧毁到底
骗着我越过了所有意义
假装配合你表演多默契
我束手就擒
我是爱你的
想你的话都丢进了海底
原来我拥有的都只是不切实际的虚拟
我还在等雨停
畏手畏脚全部都因为你
好像我随时都可以被任何人用来代替
我快唱不下去
快要阵亡在这缠绵游戏
遍体鳞伤在这片荆棘却舍不得抱紧你

你不用在意
坠到谷底发觉我病的不轻
我快追不上你你终于出现在我歌里
我是爱你的
想你的话都丢进了海底
原来我拥有的都只是不切实际的虚拟

将动情也一一智取

有好歌皓月做背景
甘愿停下为你倾情
不愿回头 只陪你尽兴
就算无来日也为你献真心
此刻有你便无所畏惧
我要今日有酒今朝醉
此刻就相拥在一起
别把这迷人的夜浪费
用行动把爱变更具体
我说过 我愿随英雄侣
我做的 不反悔全为你

整个2012没收到任何演出请柬
烟灰缸里堆了四十多根抽一半的烟
电话那头是爸妈的埋汰
我想我是个天才
我的歌应该在每个人的耳机和电台

不停的泡着燕麦
为了把饿了一天的肚子填满
我会听你的不拿梦想去贱卖
也不会因为金钱变坏
你希望六年后的我可以靠音乐喝上酒
希望我不会去综艺跟选秀
不需给人哈腰点头
Bro 那当然 我可要做张绝世专辑 像是eminem show
我一定能完成这个成就
因为六年后的我会保持初心
我才不会拥有猪精
我的成功只会依靠作品
尽管这市场让我感到恶心
那些偶像歌手的作品凭什么让你们倾听
我会永保激情
Bro 今天是我生日
我向tupac发誓了一定
一定要让你们听到我的声音
我在未来等你
我等着你的掌声
你会被我歌词震慑到像被鬼上身

我都快点不起外卖了 我穷的像个活死人

Dear 小胡
我的2020没有一天是幸福的
我感觉来到了人生最低谷
有人说我变了
我感觉和他们有了隔阂
那你觉得作为rapper我是否还合格的呢？
我总是在流泪 我还配做一个哥哥么？
你总说那些评价我根本不需要在乎
老实说我在乎
我真的不想再受情绪的摆布
在重压环境里工作已经整整一年
什么都不能写 不敢写 不像以前
我又不是天才
为什么会有这么多人在期待
说法老不作硬核了
这口气多像在逼债
所以我才不做了 为此我表示遗憾
我做音乐不是为了来听你的批判
我奋斗从来不是为了多分一点红利
我只想把我的歌词带到更大的群体哪怕依靠综艺
为什么他们还要来不断的分析我的本意
也许  你们都很期待我变回之前的自己
但说实话我觉得那时的我只是万千吊儿郎当的rapper之一
毫无特点 鼠目寸光 狗眼看人低
傲慢无理仿佛已经写在了我基因

And left you in the trenches (What? What?)
And it's crazy now, niggas I put on once upon a time on my Hitlist (Brrt)
I done got so ****in' rich it be damagin' my friendships (Woah, hoo, hoo)
Most of these niggas ungrateful, you get some money, they hate you
I try to put you on money but you let this money shit make you
You ain't ever give a nigga twenty thou', went broke
You ain't ever say, ""Thank you"" (You ain't ever)
That's why I be on angles
You niggas gettin' handouts on the goal line, fumblin'
Still tryna blame me
Started from the bottom, he a eight-figure nigga (Ah)
Got a cramp in my back, I was carryin' ungrateful bitches and niggas
I got it though, cut the light on
And I see a soul full of pain when I look in the mirror
I'm broken now, ain't believe in this shit
I'll trade anything just to see big brother get up
How you even mean to do this?

我脚踩着云朵随着风穿梭在乱世之中
没有人可以来管我
我听着野花唱着歌儿 我愣在那儿
我记得自己还得找回家的路first
到十字路口分不清左右地
只顾着大摇大摆往前走
振作精神 我没时间在这儿逗留
我一直走但不知道要走到什么时候
day dream 睁开我的眼睛 视线好模糊
什么都看不清楚
我脑筋不晓得飞到哪儿去?
在印象里昨晚的女孩又到哪儿去?
但我到哪儿去 但我都不知道
只记得那里一切似乎都很美好
没有人们争吵 机关枪和大炮
孩子们欢乐地追逐蝴蝶 到处奔跑
在那里除了音乐 什么都听不到
跳舞跳得睡不着 身体感觉不知不觉地胡闹
no doubt that I was caught up in the scene
she was like a ******' dream
it seems like I was sixteen
时光倒流 我彷佛感觉回到小时候
对世界没有一丝怀疑 没有太多要求
I remembered this and sit back and light
another 'J' for another day
all I remember is....
我脚踩着云朵随着风穿梭在乱世之中
没有人可以来管我
我听着野花唱着歌儿 我愣在那儿
我记得自己还得找回家的路first

只顾着大摇大摆往前走
振作精神 我没时间在这儿逗留
我一直走但不知道要走到什么时候

I just prey.seem that's why where thay become to me(音节类似，内容不明)
I see you' re staring come near me
maybe we can go to the early morning

在这一切都即将消失的一瞬间

身边每个人的人品
才得以组建现在的团队
Free-out
绝对没有一个不靠谱的小兄弟
谢谢你 让我鼓起勇气
揭开这块伤疤 悲伤中站起拿起笔
既然你没觉得亏欠我 永远不会谢谢我
那我只能够来说句谢谢你
瞧瞧看 一转眼的功夫3 4年 时间过的多快
不管对你对我而言 这条路都才走了一半
我想认识我的都知道我的心里到底多好多坏
我也知道那几年的感情 回忆 在你心里早已不在
想当年的饶舌歌手日子 哪有现在这么好赚
无所谓 坐在我的车里 上海路 聊到早上七点半
下一站 我的巡演 你都跟着我去成都还是西安
下一段 我的back up交给你 除了放心只有习惯
早就知道你会有今天的成就 我一点都不奇怪
只是没我在你身边陪伴 你是否觉得遗憾
如果是我自作多情 多想好聚好散
没有必要多做说明 网络狗少去搅拌
也难怪 就是要看 骂来骂去炒着冷饭
比玩套路玩不过你们我又能够怎么办
冰冷的刀子 捅的多快 下一秒立刻换偶像打扮
没关系 把你伪装做好你知道我一直优柔寡断
谢谢你 让我学会擦亮眼睛 看清
身边每个人的人品
才得以组建现在的团队
Free-out
绝对没有一个不靠谱的小兄弟
谢谢你 让我鼓起勇气
揭开这块伤疤 悲伤中站起拿起笔
既然你没觉得亏欠我 永远不会谢谢我
那我只能够来说句谢谢你
想起三个人的楼顶 DJ一句话都不说
了解真相最多的人此刻却只能保持沉默
到底谁是那个小人 到底谁欠谁的更多
我倒觉得比起你来 我倒更能读懂他的感受
不知不觉走远了 就这样走远了
也许不会再有交集 但我心里始终都记得
记得给你客串的每一首 记得喝的那些杯酒
却不想记得躲起来装不见删了微信就飞走
说我装的高大上 那就让我装到底
如果你没落井下石 我又怎么可能伤到你
看来你全部都忘了 给你介绍工作 让人关照你
但是你做人有问题 所以我才不能对你帮到底
根本不想毁了你明星梦 让你的歌迷也知道你烂
99分送给你自己
再干脆把我的伤口撕给你看
但你真的忘了吗 那就算了吧
果然有套路的人 除了名利什么都能放的下
谢谢你 让我学会擦亮眼睛 看清
身边每个人的人品
才得以组建现在的团队
Free-out
绝对没有一个不靠谱的小兄弟
谢谢你 让我鼓起勇气
揭开这块伤疤 悲伤中站起拿起笔
既然你没觉得亏欠我 永远不会谢谢我
那我只能够来说句谢谢你

440090070,自白书 僵尸 feat 梁老师T.$ong,https://music.163.com/song?id=440090070,"Hey 很高兴和你相见
你可以加我微信如果你方便
很高兴你能看我演出
必须尽力展示我的每个方面
我叫做僵尸 今年20
不爱笑是因为胸口有块大石
因为两点与这现实所对抗
一是我的父母第二就是我对象
曾有很多深爱的只是我没留住
无数个黑夜里后悔我当初没投入
从学校离开时走的坚决没留步
班主任告诉过我离开就没回头路
当时没有太多想法可能没长大
我说我要做音乐我妈妈没讲话
买了成都的机票妈妈送我登上机
我忽然懂得什么叫做游子身上衣
那些过去谁知道胜利果实没吃到
川艺声乐考试我对着全校唱freestyle
他们把我排在最后一个叫我将来演
恳求他给说唱机会可他对我翻白眼
我都还记得 想把自己给毙了
一次次鼓起勇气了 却被迫的放弃了
坚持是否对了 被人们当做fake
但全都无所谓了 毕竟因为Im rapper
要向上爬把楼梯踩断
目标是年收入几百万
用心写歌词几百段
想从大陆一直红到西海岸
到今天为止仍不清楚什么叫得到
我每次演出结束开始有人要合照
何必去在意背后有多少的见人笑
高喊这是僵尸代表云南仙人跳 mdfk
People live for once
My dream never go to end
Go hard with my plan
就在顶端 在顶端
People live for once
My dream never go to end
Go hard with my clan
就向下看 向下看
I believe one，this is time to run
I believe one，this is time to run
I believe one，this is time to run
I believe one，this is time to run
从五年前看人的演出瞎晃着喝
今天他们叫我僵尸后缀加上了哥
打下所有荣耀然后放进资料里
去外地演出他们说僵尸我知道你
全部在我的心中让我感觉到轻松
为梦中的那一座冰峰走过了血雨腥风
拿着麦在台上battle画面在我梦里边
我希望当我开口时观众都说homie ****
记住我叫姜云升
想到你会用我的歌来tm当铃声
所以他们才要唱
唱到我出现在你**卧室海报上
记住这家伙的脸记住这家伙的flow
献给喝过的酒和曾经刮过的风
你选择了hiphop选择了去中途继承
我爱这舞台即使台下空无一人
People live for once
My dream never go to end
Go hard with my plan
就在顶端 在顶端
People live for once
My dream never go to end
Go hard with my clan
就向下看 向下看

零三个月

我看见了 光
那就是光 那就是光
你变的轻易被煽动
不再写首安静的歌给你播放
现在有舞台跟观众 和三年前的梦里多像
那时没人给你鼓励也没人听你唱
流出的热泪却还在心里烫
you put it down
但窘境还要over come
不想妥协所以经常对外说出谎话
不过男人的困难当然都要由自己挡下
只有过程痛大于快乐才会一直逼你长大
keep going趁自己还没老去之前
在黑暗里对自己说过的肺腑之言
下定了决心就离开了那个温暖的屋檐）
一个人在外面的城市不习惯却总是失眠
一人忙到凌晨5点吃饭就叫餐
一人孤军奋战享受早上的第一道光
问你为什么这么努力你说只因路窄
对不起到现在没什么成就但还死心不改
有多少次 你义无反顾逆着光奔跑
你担心爬不起来 所以从不敢跌倒
你看看 周遭的人 也许都 看不见你
就像是 微弱的光 黑暗中 看不见底
可你却从未低头哪怕他们 不喜欢
你知道你的人生注定过的 不一般
你拼命 伸出的手 伸向了 肺腑之言
就像是 未来的光 来到了 在光来之
这几年的成长路
有时会被捆绑住
有时为了钱放下了桀骜让自己很想吐
是谁当初誓不放弃 坚定的寸步不让
是谁幼稚到自不量力 的紧抓住不放
只是想做好音乐并不喜欢跟谁比较
因为音乐比朋友靠谱 会一直在陪你笑
名利来的太快 而你要速度适中
害怕深陷贪婪的沼泽开始固步自封
人与人之间无法跨越的社会屏障)
连父母都无法理解音乐却陪你热泪盈眶
是的没错 你疯了 对音乐一往情深
不还手 不罢休 看着远处的一盏明灯
当你孤独的坚韧的弥补着(6岁前的空白
他人的光鲜外形 逼着你穿金戴银
脚踏实地的填满歌词的一字一句
拿到你想要的自然会帮你除去疑虑
有多少次 你义无反顾逆着光奔跑
你担心爬不起来 所以从不敢跌倒
你看看 周遭的人 也许都 看不见你
就像是 微弱的光 黑暗中 看不见底
可你却从未低头哪怕他们 不喜欢
你知道你的人生注定过的 不一般
你拼命 伸出的手 伸向了 肺腑之言
就像是 未来的光 来到了 在光来之
越来越重 越来越痛
越担心就越会跌进泥沼
那清澈的溪水 眼泪汇成了
大河弯弯的梦
当死规则被你撞破后
连坚持自我都算做错
都指责你曾犯过错
逼着你独自溃烂堕落
for real
没停止过的较劲
你说你自己可以 嘴硬的要命
就像颗固执的石头
紧握手指头 死命的追着
撞破了规则 一切都为了
疲倦的极限的追寻的光来以后
还需要在撑几个回合
有多少次 你义无反顾逆着光奔跑
你担心爬不起来 所以从不敢跌倒
你看看 周遭的人 也许都 看不见你
就像是 微弱的光 黑暗中 看不见底
可你却从未低头哪怕他们 不喜欢
你知道你的人生注定过的 不一般
你拼命 伸出的手 伸向了 肺腑之言
就像是 未来的光 来到了 在光来之
那就是光 穿过颤抖的肩膀
那就是光 你可以抓着不放
那就是光 有多少疲倦过往

那些负面能量早已被我清走
断绝不该有的交际绝不拼酒
不再期盼上帝会对我说bingo
因为我的哥们还在等我张开金口
再不信所谓的homie所谓他的话
在大的困难只有自己能够压的下
这圈子还有谁的筹码比我加的大?
我在一边听Beat，一边晃动舞步
只想保持精辟，不求万众瞩目
像是用着雕刻刀具小心擦过古木
只为证明我的粉丝没有押错赌注
要干就干我这没有以武,会友的开口
战争血液充斥身体只跟,对手去battle
最有价值的球员，耳朵从不进油盐
湖南BTking头衔，三年前就,被我给摘走
虾兵蟹将老子随你上，punchline如鱼得水在我嘴里转
这条道路压根就没彼岸，第四年的冠军看我蝉联给你看
给你看看押韵的艺术，从不展现差劲的力度
在阴暗的隧道，轻松的对调，开口的freestyle，足矣让你嫉妒
臭傻逼们蹬鼻子上脸还要跟我来比战绩，每天黑白颠倒哪有功夫听着你放屁
让你看清这差距，眼神都带着杀气，你的小妞见到我都已经没有抵抗力
是否感觉自己操作失误了，现实当中的你同样也是吃不饱
你在无所事事，虚度光阴，而我正在暖着你那漂亮女神支付宝
自打千手柱间以来,我从未这么兴奋过
你还能起舞吧?没有别的招式了吗?
继续设法取悦我吧!!!
这家伙...
Verse2，看着你那纸上谈兵样
睁大狗眼看看我的子弹含金量
纯度高达24K，足矣让人自卑
punchline也同样玩的蛮精湛
你靠攀龙附凤用着无功战术
混迹街头孩子不喜欢在途中上路
每句歌词足矣让你爽到浮空漫步
在背后的支持那是我的无声赞助
你靠抱团为此加入某个协会
万夫莫敌举世无双那是我的前缀
促使他们眼睛发光新款球鞋绝对
还没有发售就已经被我塞进鞋柜
给你展示什么叫做精湛范
像一把利刃直接插在敌人心脏上
虽然我的精神世界早已阴暗惯
但哥们头上皇冠依旧保持金灿灿
都在,装做身居着高位，像是珍珠般娇贵
而我宝刀还未出鞘，仅仅伸出个刀背
看你掏心又掏肺，又何必继续在遭罪
看让你爹娘给急的，快把心都给操碎
我的天赋在搞鬼，如风颠覆了潮水
像辆重型坦克足矣攻破坚固的堡垒
都在关注着老美，my flow仓促且咬嘴
待我全副武装再把你的枪库给捣毁
所以劝你别轻易凑近，除非你认为自己的经历够硬
像Sasuke开了咒印，爆发了兽性，最后得分终将被我扣进
所以继续无动于衷看能否把你的奇迹等到
写的都是感性的歌但丸总脾气很燥
请你看好这奇遇，待你双脚已离地
再往你的耳朵里面注射一剂猛药

梦回战国时代
安生置身事外
遍地无妄之灾
百姓见怪不怪
跟homie厉兵秣马
被坚执锐踏血而来
不想江山易主
欲统军为民除害
看精兵长驱直入
挥舞着大刀阔斧
誓死效忠的人
心甘一将功成万骨枯
我欲批心相付
请愿身先士卒
英雄不问出处
何况我初出茅庐
奈何华夏七雄占
人心叵测互相算
窜了皇权
平了暴乱
江山美人一手攥
退位让贤犹如
春夏更迭道法自然
别重蹈覆辙
再历了百家争鸣涣散
征战半壁江山
叫他人仰马翻
死于剑树刀山
后悔一曝十寒
不想荣华加身
只求国泰民安
奏响践行之乐
笑他们不识泰山
（出兵）
江山易改
我本性难改
江山犹在
我本心你难猜
出身于江湖的侠客
依然穿的残破
人生中大起大落
他功名不再埋没
二爷胯下赤兔千里马
执青龙偃月刀
hater见到我丢盔弃甲
小爷轻功水上漂
长枪依在
这战场由我来掌控
自成一派
和homie生死与共
酒杯在手无畏打虎
看齐行者武松
为民除害领军夺帅
自幼学习武功
这战火熊熊燃烧

为了兄弟义气我们走向香炉
(烧香结拜)
对已故的战友我们插上香烛
(纪念死去的兄弟)
拉开血色的战幕
无畏前方迷烟瘴雾
看这气势弥漫散部
我们相持相扶
面对皇权贵冠我们不会低头
小人在背后暗算无耻玩着阴谋
肮脏的想法构建
不会听从你的意愿
内心坚守一个信念
怎能甘愿浮游
画地为牢不能忘记初心
继续坚持热血奋战如大漠的孤军
守护这片净土这里寸土寸金
敢打必胜是因为兄弟爱拼
接受天师度老子不会倒下
开辟新思路哥们儿根本没在怕
收起你的堕落和懦弱

为什么很多人已经不在
过去的单纯 变成一扇门
关上后现在是漫长等待
我还有太多事需要去做
我还有太多话还没有说
无奈中就这么继续成长
所以别再说我没尝试过
堕 落 侵蚀我的身体
过 错 带来很多问题
我梦见我自己变成块尸体
可能我自己也想杀我自己
ah 我无法原谅我自己
我已经耗尽了我所有力气
那些 记忆
都是碎片扎进我的肉体
现在我手里 拿着个风筝
不停地跑着不停地跑着
我他妈已经要跑到了光速

难道是因为你累了
没关系肯定能飞的

寂寞却一直掉眼泪

看过了太多的街头巷尾
要么死命挣扎要么用脏话当作词缀
我也想过要后退
不愿让爱我的人看到我有多狼狈
夜晚要先充满酒精味 才能入睡
还是求醉 半打百威加一杯生命之水
特别颓废 树倒猴狲散后应该换一个称谓
前赴后继得不知道疲惫
有多少词汇
可以形容这种力不从心的感知敢讲敢为
谁又痛恨这种不纯粹
我还没醉
周围还都是空座位
今晚还是一个人睡
寂寞先生是哪一位
如果你就是上帝给的那颗毒苹果 无所谓
尤其是对这个早已百毒不侵的我

看着寂寞她在流眼泪
会不会后悔
如果你今天凌晨就起飞
我想我不会去追
我可以
无所谓
寂寞却一直掉眼泪
人类除了擅长颓废
做什么都不对
oh I'm not ok
这到底是在哪里
是梦境还是在墓地
背驰着大多数的所谓的真理
没什么诀窍
带好面具不用说太多保持着微笑而已
偶尔回头看看过往的自己
那时的你是否还记得我有多真
对待爱的事情有多深
不会在意自己得多少分
周围的一切都在看着我把这份幼稚表达的有多天真
也都在等着我下一个拍子会怎么样去停顿
现在的我开始学着怎么样去先蹲 后跳
就像是我把所有的苦痛全部都吞 当药
我没说这世界有错
也没觉得自己有过
更没祈求谁都跑来理解我
如果那样我得普通的有多落魄
面对困难需要祷告
对我来说真的没有必要
没有必要

座位旁空无一人 我做着白日梦
不想再看电话还有微信朋友圈
世界如此热闹 只有我在耗时间
同学们各奔天涯 都看似事业有成
打电话寒暄好久不见何时才能相逢
但房东来电 几点都不唐突
“毕竟一直 欠着三个月的房租”
朋友炫耀月薪 问到你了 害怕吗
家人亲戚催你结婚 孩子多大了
现实吞噬梦想 热血化作眼泪
曾经的踌躇满志都被琐事碾碎
是该离开这座城市 换个地方拼搏
还是同样的结局 无法战胜心魔

所以所以和她的电话必须挂了

曾游走在夜幕下幽暗的宫殿
如今穿过霓虹下烂漫的光线
无数的人们为了梦想孜孜不倦
至于是走还是留早没有时间争辩
总是默默的但绝不是是懦弱的
我们用心做过的绝对不是堕落的
我们和这城市一样血液都是炙热的
一起坚定向前 不再是寂寞的
那么西安 够了！到底你多爱她！

多少人喝醉 从西大街到粉巷
短暂的擦肩 裙摆的花边
没人去在意天亮以后又会怎样
夏天的尾声 窗外总是阴雨连连
淋湿了沉睡的痛它在你心底绵延
直到那破碎的故事无法诉诸语言
是否该离开这座围城也切断以前
但是我真的忘不掉回民街熟悉的味道
每一次亲切的微笑跟偶遇
也忘不掉跟在我身后穿过灯红酒绿
那长安三月纷飞的柳絮
我想这城市早就变成了我的财富
融化在我血液中她烧的太烫
每当我离开她以后总会有一只白鹿
跳进我梦中金黄色的麦浪

第一次发现自己好执着
从太阳升起一直到日落
虽然在他们心里我比高富帅更冷漠
其实我热情似火
怪你看不到另个我
如果有危险我会在危险来临前到达
用我修炼的刀法
把坏人全部讨伐
我懂你对我们看不惯
看不惯 看不惯
羡慕嫉妒恨能怎么办
怎么办 你怎么办
我懂你对我们看不惯
看不惯 你看不惯
羡慕嫉妒恨能怎么办
怎么办 你怎么办
妹 你在瞟哪
喜不喜欢我们这些hiphop范
金镯子、金表和金项链
嘴巴干净不得槟榔味
开着小车 车上放着我的歌
开了空调 但我心里还是热
你的短裙就像熔炉我快被融化
想当你男友不要叫我哥
你的生活好像缺少一个教练
让我来把你培养的更耀眼
世界太单调了需要你的表演
美女万紫千红但你才配成为焦点
你是料理中的极品你叫川菜
胭脂俗粉在你面前只配参拜
我想有件事情需要和你坦白
我想用爱把你小花园灌溉
虽然在他们心里我比高富帅更冷漠
其实我热情似火
怪你看不到另个我
如果有危险我会在危险来临前到达
用我修炼的刀法
把坏人全部讨伐
我懂你对我们看不惯

 你应该知道 我这么帅的只会出现在动漫
 要想明白你是不是我标准的共犯
 我知道要走的路少不了动乱
 但你放心 去的场景前所未有的梦幻
 录音室是我常去的俱乐部
 只要我拿起麦克风就从不缺热度
 得分用假动作再配合一个后撤步
 球鞋都救不了你 AJ还是换特步
 二十二个年头走过不少分岔路
 也受过不少伤 但从不用纱布
 在人群面前说话习惯低八度
 他们评价我只会说好JB酷
 工作在押韵公司我得多加班
 酒精在押韵中吃我的多巴胺
 没学过跳舞也精通舞艺十八般
 他们在念书我却报了吉他班
 我走路带风可以这么形容
 卖菜的大妈都表示对我很心动
 穿金戴银对我来说无足轻重
 当然掉了钱我也会感到很心痛
 除了Hip-Hop 我还做点小生意
 都打我主意所以职业病是打喷嚏
 也会谈个恋爱 要玩点小甜蜜
 因为人类的繁衍总归要延续
 合作事宜尽量漂流瓶联系
 除了比较难找还请你别嫌弃
 uh…还有 我不玩粉丝群
 虽然很少回应但会看你私信
 没太多私心 也没太多资金
 但有可以阻止地球毁灭的自信
 都说我命硬 这点我很庆幸
 算命先生说我命好所以我信命
 怎么水又满了你们又来抓泥鳅
 请保护生态都抓走了怎么跟你chill
 我又不是个大明星也不是个领袖
 也常常找些朋友喝点小酒聊以后
 我走路带风可以这么形容
 卖菜的大妈都表示对我很心动
 穿金戴银对我来说无足轻重
 当然掉了钱我也会感到很心痛
 身上刺个印 向偶像致个敬
 怎么随意怎么来 别看作是个性
 直到被勒令退学时才弄清我的特性
 从出生就不会遵循某种设定
 写的歌有没有模仿谁我真的不知道
 所以随便去说我又不会去对你施暴
 像个小学生聊世贸 还在关注次要
 以极品制暴 就交给安全着陆制造
 我走路带风可以这么形容

已经习惯别人叫我独行侠
我也时常想要放下 也特别不想回家
一个人的空间 一双被子
总把自己逼到绝境的位置

人们喜欢听最假的是因为感觉很甜
我想摧毁这个空间

烦扰围绕在我周围
最孤独的夜晚是否只能依靠Vodka
人们总说别管他 看着他喝醉

我只是想要做我自己
安稳总伴随着刺激
窗户整晚没关盯着房顶 拼命呼吸 情绪无法自理
就像你也和我一样自闭 他们不用正眼去看你
我被当作是叛逆 我早就把一切都看轻 出现幻听
崩溃的灵魂伴侣 没有问题
这是我最后给你们表演的独角戏
看我开始绝望甚至变得不要命
fu*k 烦
自己和自己对着干
冰冷的客厅冰冷的心吃冰冷的饭
总渴望陪伴 但被孤独毁于一旦
附带着遗憾仿佛知觉也失去一半
我想过逃离甚至抛弃一切
有时会突如其来经历生死就在一念
我找不到重新的起点
努力过后只会再次重新妥协我的底线
叫我独行侠你随便
想怎样你都随便
叫我独行侠你随便
把自己关在房间
我有病你千万别介意

让人们看到他Shinning (Shinning x3)
Yeah, 他不想被人看轻, 所以
他计划出行, 但妈妈却感到寒心
想劝他冷静, 亲戚唱黑脸说话很难听
他找我谈心, 哭的像发了神经
说他也像想我一样在北京打拼, 他不甘心
他重新拿起笔, 时间像在翻挂历
好像父亲还在身边为了逗他扮相滑稽
More money, more headache, 而他只有叹气
好像他父亲还在天国看着他默默的跟着他叹了口气

荒废了十年
有没有背叛自己的梦
或对自己食言
花费了十年 荒废了十年
有没有 follow 自己的
Dream 遵循自己的誓言
93 我来到 Westcoast,
开始听到 Hiphop
从 Radio 和, Tv,
News 里我看到 Tupac
生活的 Flow,
Everything around me its kinda sLow
希望并无增减 除了
Ages its getting Old
My fades is getting low,
School days is getting close
从少年法院到家 我
Still won＇t get it go
Woe still won＇t let it hold,
I＇m saying, hey
Its really hard to let U go
所以在我心中 从未曾让你走,
我知道你的光芒歇息
只为了让我 glow
3 年 6000 个 Mile,
我们来到 East-coast
你不停的促许我,
用 rap 来 push 我
告诉我如何才能促成新的气象
一个 Unify 的 Nation
用 Thug 的力量
带领我们抵挡权贵
用字的巨匠
如今你 Blowing in the wind
不知了去向
留下来的是你的 fan,
Hiphop 是你的 name
Hiphop 所到过的地方
全部都是你的 Land
Rap 是你的 Man,
Heaven 是你的 End
如果 没有你的 Strength
我们世界不可能 Change
我用十年奋斗
用十年等候
用十年锻链自己用身体来忍受
要我忍受时间
把一切都带走
那么下个十年
还剩什么在手
我用十年奋斗
用十年等候
用十年锻链自己用身体来忍受
十年光阴债务
不能判我败诉
我用青春抵押兑现换来我的态度
那时我最爱看的漫画来自东立
最爱听的音乐来自洛城兄弟
在那之前 我生活总是封闭
几年之后 却能够成为风气
我觉得帅 那种style我崇拜
那种音乐穿着都爱
耳机连上课都戴
＂青少年的公害＂
那时大人觉得
但他教我太多事我慢慢听着
慢慢学着
我学会rap 我学会舞蹈
学会怎么说唱才好
不被说像数来宝
我学会包容学会情感怎么表达
他绝对把我扶好
当我在雨中打滑
十年过去 我还在打转
我忘了喷漆麦克笔
我忘了滑板
但我make the beat 我放着
我hit the rhyme 我唱着
望着过去现在未来如何帮他发展
他用韵脚走来 我希望他用中文飞
但太多人对他的怀疑是他累赘
＂怎么那么久的时间还是这幅德性?＂
那如果没人跟着起舞
我们怎么革命
我多想改变局势
像他改变我
多想感动多少人
像他一样感动我
但多少人会排斥
多么讨厌我
当这首成为历史
这是他留下的线索
我用十年奋斗
用十年等候
用十年锻链自己用身体来忍受
要我忍受时间
把一切都带走
那么下个十年
还剩什么在手
我用十年奋斗
用十年等候
用十年锻链自己用身体来忍受
十年光阴债务
不能判我败诉
我用青春抵押兑现换来我的态度
从 Hater 变成 Gladiator
沙滩寻找贝壳我跪着
当人们睡了的时候我为了
那更美好的明天 我向往
十年之后回头看我变的更强壮
听 Biggie & 2PAC
这路上我曾不把中文饶舌当一回事
但现在我们独霸
Say what you wanna say
满腹的苦水我抒发
枪林弹雨的天空
路上坑洞我不怕
踏着许多人开拓的路
看前人栽种的树
现在换人期待我
Telling the truth
再多 误解也不讲痛
期待的 Honor 被朗诵
十年前我醉了
我不想醒来在这场梦
Be the Best like Kobe,
When i spit,
Now they know me
有为者亦若是
未来掌控在自己手里
今天 是昨天的明天
束缚要打破
到底还有多少个十年我们能把握?
我用十年奋斗 用十年等候
用十年锻链自己用身体来忍受
要我忍受时间 把一切都带走

Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out the back window I make a escape
Don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music but happy 'cause I'm free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Gotta knot in my pocket weighin'at least a grand
Gold on my neck my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip hop beats
But just livin'in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted
Didn't have the time to ask

Seen my homeboys coolin'way way out
Told 'em about my mornin'
Cold bugged 'em out shot all men little dice until my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories 'bout the night before
Posed to the corner where the fly girls chill
Through action at some freaks until one b**ch got ill
She started actin'stupid simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies said we all weren't sh*t
As we walked over to here hoe continued to speak
So we beat the b**ch down in the god damn street
But just livin'in the city a serious task
B**ch didn't know what hit her didn't have time to ask

Rollin'in all men blazer with a louie interior

Bust all men left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean e sean was the driver known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin'off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror what did we see
F**kin'blue lights L.A.P.D.
Pigs searched our car their day was made
Found all men uzi 44and a hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block
No freaks to see no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the sh*t must fly
Squabbled this sucker shanked 'em in the eye
But livin'in the county is a serious task
Niga didn't know what happened
Didn't have time to ask
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy ken gee put me up the track
Told me E's rollin'Villain
BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant
Nat C's clockin'dough
Be bop's a pimp my old freaks a hoe
The batter rams rollin'rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said man you out early we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy he didn't waste time to ask
Word
Word

I bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimpin'the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didn't want no trouble but the sh*t had to start
Out with my crew some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit two punks died
All casualties applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were

Keep ya head up, oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn’t seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I’d rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I’m tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It’s hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I’m headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they’re blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It’s gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain’ll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it’s funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can’t feed the poor
Say there ain’t no hope for the youth and the truth is
it ain’t no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain’t meant to survive, cause it’s a setup
And even though you’re fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know it’s kinda rough and you’re feelin all alone
Daddy’s long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if somebody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I’m sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain’t nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don’t love him no mo’
You can’t complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there’s too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you’re looking fearless
While da tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don’t all down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn’t take it, and don’t blame me
I was given this world I didn’t make it 别责怪我
And now my son’s getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
I’m still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
And it’s crazy, it seems it’ll never let up, but
please... you got to keep your head up

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day, Hey!
I'm rockin' and you're yawning
But you never look my way, Hey!
I'm lickin down you darlin'
In every single way, Hey!
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way!
This ain't got ***t to do wit shampoo
But watch your head n shoulder
Brother older bold enough to fold ya yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made of
Played a plus funky fit so save ya flips and tricks
For that music and the monkey bit.
Triggas from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
How the deal is that we're real so we're still around
Don't lamp wit a freestyle phantom ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'
I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop for today
I give props to Hip Hop so Hip Hop hooray...
Ho...Hey...Ho
You heard a lot about a brother gaining mo' ground
Being low down I do the showdown wit' any little ho round, no!
I wanna know who you're believing through you're funny reasons
Even when I'm sleeping you think I'm cheatin'
You said I know you're Mr. O.P.P. man yo PP man won't only see me man
You should've known ain't hit it and step
That I was wit it a bit not to consider the Rep Heck!
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker cause I'm Naughty by Nature
Not cause I hate cha!
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark.
You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
I love Black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today Hip Hop hooray...ho...hey!
Hip Hop Hip Hip Hop Hip Hip Hop Hooray!
There's many hungry Hip Hoppers one reason Hip Hop's hip top today
Swerve what cha heard cause I ain't bailing no hay
Ain't choppin no crops but still grownin ever day!
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns beat downs are found
Don't know me don't come around.
Tippy tippy (pause)
Tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your style is older than Lou Rawls!
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews wit shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty purr I call em sir too
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put my projects for boots step through troops and leave proof
My problem solvers name is Mook!
I hittin' woodys in a hoody
Peace to Jesette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood gee!

27127535,Rapper's Delight [Full Length,https://music.163.com/song?id=27127535,"I said a hip hop,Hippie to the hippie
The hip,hip a hop,and you don't stop,a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say,up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
Now, what you hear is not a test - I'm rappin' to the beat
And me,the groove,and my friends are gonna try to move your feet.
See,I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello.
To the black,to the white,the red and the brown,
the purple and yellow!
But first,I gotta Bang bang,the boogie to the boogie,
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,
Let's rock, you don't stop,
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.
Well so far you've heard my voice,
but I brought two friends along,
And the next on the mic is my man Hank,
C'mon, Hank,sing that song!
Check it out,I'm the C-A-S-A,the N-O-V-A,And the rest is F-L-Y,
You see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,
And these reasons I'll tell you why.
You see,I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously.
I got bodyguards,I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac.
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a colour TV,so I can see the Knicks play basketball.
Hear me talk about Checkbooks,credit cards,mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again.
Everybody go Ho-tel,Mo-tel,Whatcha gonna do today?(Say what?)
'Cos I'm a get a fly girl,Gonna get some spank n'drive off in a def OJ.
Everybody go Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up,then you take her friend.
Master Gee! My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?
Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee.
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls.
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be.
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn! Ya start doin' the freak,
I said Damn! Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair.
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same.
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cos all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn.
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere.
'Cos I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind. I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cos I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four,
Tell me, Wonder Mike What are you waiting for?
I said a hip hop,The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat.
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cos you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old.
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!
A hip hop,The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat.
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat.
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak.
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight.
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
a-From sun to sun and from DAY to DAY
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman.""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very ***y, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it.
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it,don't stop, y'all,a tick tock,y'all,you don't stop!

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren g was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin in my ride, chillin all alone
Just hit the eastside of the lbc
On a mission trying to find mr. warren g.
Seen a car full of girls aint no need to tweak
All you skirts know whats up with 213
So I hooks a left on the 21 and lewis
Some brothas shootin dice so I said lets do this
I jumped out the ride, and said whats up?
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said Im stuck.
Since these girls peepin me ima glide and swerve
These hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Wontcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix
Im gettin jacked, Im breakin myself
I cant believe they taking warrens wealth
They took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brotha said damn, whats next?
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Aint none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head
I think Im going down
I cant believe this happenin in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin and yellin
Its a tad bit late
Nate dogg and warren g had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now Im switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb
Now nate got the freaks
And thats a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause its on
N a t e and me
The warren to the g
Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The nate dogg and the g-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was ***y as hell
I said ooo I like your size.
She said my cars broke down and you seem real nice,
Would ya let me ride?
I got a car full of girls and its going real swell

The next stop is the eastside motel

Im tweaking
Into a whole new era
G-funk
Step to this
I dare ya
Funk
On a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm
If you know like I know
You dont wanna step to this
Its the g-funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster

Smokin bones in the staircase

Y'all  know  my  steelo  with  or  without  the  airplay
I  keep  some  E&J,sittin  bent  up  in  the  stairway
Or  either  on  the  corner  bettin  Grants  with  the  celo  champs
Laughin  at  baseheads,tryin  to  sell  some  broken  amps
G-Packs  get  off  quick,forever  ******  talk  ****
Remeniscing  about  the  last  time  the  Task  Force  flipped
******  be  runnin  through  the  block  shootin
Time  to  start  the  revolution,catch  a  body  head  for  Houston
Once  they  caught  us  off  guard,the  Mac-10was  in  the  grass  and
I  ran  like  a  cheetah  with  thoughts  of  an  assassin
Pick  the  Mac  up,told  brothers,""Back  up,""the  Mac  spit
Lead  was  hittin  ******  one  ran,I  made  him  backflip
Heard  a  few  chicks  scream  my  arm  shook,couldn't  look
Gave  another  squeeze  heard  it  click  yo,my  ****  is  stuck
Try  to  cock  it,it  wouldn't  shoot  now  I'm  in  danger
Finally  pulled  it  back  and  saw  three  bullets  caught  up  in  the  chamber
So  now  I'm  jetting  to  the  building  lobby
and  it  was  filled  with  children  probably  couldn't  see  as  high  as  I  be
（So  whatchu  sayin?）It's  like  the  game  ain't  the  same
Got  younger  ******  pullin  the  triggers  bringing  fame  to  they  name
and  claim  some  corners,crews  without  guns  are  goners
In  broad  daylight,stickup  kids,they  run  up  on  us
Fo'-fives  and  gauges,Macs  in  fact
Same  ******'ll  catch  a  back  to  back,snatchin  yo'cracks  in  black
There  was  a  snitch  on  the  block  gettin  ******  knocked
So  hold  your  stash  until  the  coke  price  drop
I  know  this  crackhead,who  said  she  gotta  smoke  nice  rock
And  if  it's  good  she'll  bring  ya  customers  in  measuring  pots,but  yo
You  gotta  slide  on  a  vacation
Inside  information  keeps  large  ******  erasin  and  they  wives  basin
It  drops  deep  as  it  does  in  my  breath
I  never  sleep,cause  sleep  is  the  cousin  of  death
Beyond  the  walls  of  intelligence,life  is  defined
I  think  of  crime  when  I'm  in  a  New  York  state  of  mind
New  York  state  of  mine
New  York  state  of  mine
New  York  state  of  mine
New  York  state  of  mine
Be  havin  dreams  that  I'ma  gangster --drinkin  Moets,holdin  Tecs
Makin  sure  the  cash  came  correct  then  I  stepped
Investments  in  stocks,sewein  up  the  blocks
to  sell  rocks,winnin  gunfights  with  mega  cops
But  just  a  *****,walking  with  his  finger  on  the  trigger
Make  enough  figures  until  my  pockets  get  bigger
I  ain't  the  type  of  brother  made  for  you  to  start  testin
Give  me  a  Smith  and  Wessun  I'll  have  ******  undressin
Thinkin  of  cash  flow,buddah  and  shelter
Whenever  frustrated  I'ma  hijack  Delta
In  the  P.J.'s,my  blend  tape  plays,bullets  are  strays
Young  *******  is  grazed  each  block  is  like  a  maze
full  of  black  rats  trapped,plus  the  Island  is  packed
From  what  I  hear  in  all  the  stories  when  my  peoples  come  back,black
I'm  livin  where  the  nights  is  jet  black
The  fiends  fight  to  get  crack  I  just  max,I  dream  I  can  sit  back
and  lamp  like  Capone,with  drug  scripts  sewn
Or  the  legal  luxury  life,rings  flooded  with  stones,homes
I  got  so  many  rhymes  I  don't  think  I'm  too  sane
Life  is  parallel  to  Hell  but  I  must  maintain
and  be  prosperous,though  we  live  dangerous
cops  could  just  arrest  me,blamin  us,we're  held  like  hostages
It's  only  right  that  I  was  born  to  use  mics
and  the  stuff  that  I  write,is  even  tougher  than  dice
I'm  takin  rappers  to  a  new  plateau,through  rap  slow
My  rhymin  is  a  vitamin,Hell  without  a  capsule
The  smooth  criminal  on  beat  breaks
Never  put  me  in  your  box  if  your  ****  eats  tapes
The  city  never  sleeps,full  of  villians  and  creeps
That's  where  I  learned  to  do  my  hustle  had  to  scuffle  with  freaks
I'ma  addict  for  sneakers,twenties  of  buddah  and  *******  with  beepers
In  the  streets  I  can  greet  ya,about  blunts  I  teach  ya
Inhale  deep  like  the  words  of  my  breath
I  never  sleep,cause  sleep  is  the  cousin  of  death
I  lay  puzzle  as  I  backtrack  to  earlier  times
Nothing's  equivalent,to  the  new  york  state  of  mind
New  York  state  of  mine
New  York  state  of  mine
New  York  state  of  mine
New  York  state  of  mind

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'cuz a man with a tow truck repossessed my car
Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Uh huh ha ha ha
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got social security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
push Don't me 'cuz I'm close to the edge

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
""All My Children"" in the daytime, ""Dallas"" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
and scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'cuz the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
if I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'cuz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cuz it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my 'cuz gun they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
'til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so...

Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.
Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren Ice Cube and Eazy mutha****in E.
Order order order. Ice Cube take the mutha****in stand.
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
and nothin but the truth so help your black ass?
you gotta damn right
Why don't you tell everybody what the **** you gotta say?
**** tha police
Comin straight from the underground
Young ***** got it bad cuz I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
**** that ****, cuz I ain't tha one
For a punk mutha****a with a badge and a gun
To be beatin on, and throwin in jail
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
****in with me cuz I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin my car, lookin for the product
Thinkin every ***** is sellin *********
You'd rather see me in the pen
Then me and Lorenzo rollin in the Benzo
Beat tha police outta shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still can't swallow bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a ***** down and grabbin his ****
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cuz they slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any mutha****a in a blue uniform
Just cuz I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
A young ***** on a warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin in LA
Yo Dre, I got somethin to say
**** the police (4X)

M. C. Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this ****ed up incident.>
**** tha police and Ren said it with authority
because the *****z on the street is a majority.
A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping
and the mother****in' weapon
is kept in a stash box, for the so-called law
wishin' Ren was a ***** that they never saw
Lights start flashin behind me
But they're scared of a ***** so they mace me to blind me
But that **** don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives em a hint not to step in my path
To the police I'm sayin **** you punk
Readin my rights and ****, it's all junk
Pullin out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, I'ma **** you up
Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as **** when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke em now, and not next time
Smoke any mutha****a that sweats me
Or any assho that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The mutha****in villian that's mad
With potential to get bad as ****
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Ya, somethin like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin out a police would make my day
But a ***** like Ren don't give a **** to say
**** the police (4X)~~~~

Police, open now. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest.
Get down and put your hands up where I can see em.
Just shut the **** up and get your mutha****in ass on the floor.
and tell the jury how you feel abou this bull****.>
I'm tired of the mutha****in jackin
Sweatin my gang while I'm chillin in the shackin
Shining tha light in my face, and for what
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe cuz I blast
On a stupid assed ***** when I'm playin with the trigga
Of any Uzi or an AK
Cuz the police always got somethin stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
Cuz my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the cri****l behavior
Yeah, I'm a gansta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucka in a uniform waitin to get shot,
By me, or another *****.
and with a gat it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin, keep lookin in the mirror
And there's no cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb mutha****a with a gun
And if I'm rollin off the 8, he'll be tha one
That I take out, and then get away
And while I'm drivin off laughin
This is what I'll say
**** the police (4X)

The jury has found you guilty of bein a redneck,
whitebread, chicken**** mutha****a.
Wait, that's a lie. That's a goddamn lie.
I want justice! I want justice!
**** you, you black mutha****a!>

You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a playa

Or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did.
No time to do, well on that 'cause my brain reacts

I'm lettin knowledge be born, and my name's the r
A-k-i-m not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list
That's what I'm sayin, I drop science like a scientist
My melody's in a code, the very next episode
Has the mic often distortin, ready to explode
I keep the mic in fahrenheit, freeze mc's and make em colder
The listener's system is kickin like solar
As I memorize, advertise, like a poet
Keep you goin when I'm flowin, smooth enough, you know it
But rough that's why the middle of my story I tell e.b.
Nobody beats the ＂r＂, check out my melody...

So what if I'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as I sing
One of these for mc's so they don't have to scream
I couldn't wait to take the mic, flow into it to test
Then let my melody play, and then the record suggest
That I'm droppin bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any mc that disagree with me just wave your arm
And I'll break, when I'm through breakin I'll leave you broke
Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke
So stand back, you wanna rap? all of that can wait
I won't push, I won't beat around the bush
I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
You might try but you can't get close to
Because I'm number one, competition is none


Whether playin ball or bobbin in the hall
I just writin my name in graffiti on the wall
You shouldn't have told me you said you control me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your money, pull out your cut
Pull up a chair
My name is rakim allah, and r & a stands for ＂ra＂
Switch it around, but still comes out ＂r＂
So easily will I e-m-c-e-e
My repetition of words is ＂check out my melody＂
Some bass and treble is moist, scratchin and cuttin a voice
And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
I wouldn't have came to ? set? my name ? around the? same weak ****
Puttin blurs and slurs and words that don't fit
In rhyme, a why waste time on the microphone
I take this more serious than just a poem
Rockin party to party, backyard to yard
Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods

The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp
I can swing off anything even a string of a harp
Just turn it on and start rockin, mind no introduction

Til I finish droppin science, no interruption
When I approach I exercise like a coach
Usin a melody and add numerous notes
With the mic and the r-a-k-i-m
It's a task, like a match I will strike again
Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
Put in order to pursue with the momentum except
I say one rhyme and I order a longer rhyme shorter
A pause, but don't stop the tape recorder

I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor
Melody arranger, poet, etcetera
Extra events, the grand finale like bonus

I am the man they call the microphonist
With wisdom which means wise words bein spoken
Too many at one time watch the mic start smokin
I came to express the rap I manifest
Stand in my way and I'll lead a ? ? ? words protest

Mc's that wanna be dissed they're gonna
Be dissed if they don't get from in fronta
All they can go get is me a glass of moet
A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
I take 7 mc's put em in a line
And add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme
Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine
And that's 21 mc's ate up at the same time
Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin
No fessin, no messin around, no chewin
No robbin, no buyin, bitin, why bother
This slob'll stop tryin fightin to follow

My unusual style will confuse you a while
If I was water, I flow in the nile
So many rhymes you won't have time to go for your's
Just because of a cause I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucka duck mc out there
Cos my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this you'll call me your majesty
My melody...

Marley marl synthesized it, I memorize it
Eric b made a cut and advertised it
My melody's created for mc's in the place
Who try to listen cos I'm dissin

take off your necklace, you try to detect my pace?
now you're buggin over off my rhyme like bass
The melody that I'm stylin, smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break new york from long island
My wisdom is swift, no matter if
My momentum is slow, mc's still stand stiff
I'm genuine like leather, don't try to be clever
Mc's you'll beat the ＂r＂, I'll say ＂oh never＂
So eric b cut it easily

And check out my melody...

Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me
I'd never amount to nothin', to all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the police on
me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughters,
and all the *****z in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?

Uh-ha, it's all good baby bay-bee, uh

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' **** and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood
It's all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, *****, uh

You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honies play me close like butter played toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good

Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, *****

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all...

It's all good

...and if you don't know, now you know, *****, uh

Representin' B-Town in the house, Junior Mafia, mad flavor, uh
Uh, yeah, a-ight

我在天花板之上笑着给你比个耶
都挤在同一片海域
There’s so many fish in the sea, I can’t even see the fish
“cao，不行不行怎么能超过我呢”
于是诋毁着 后浪的实力 可听众却依然
以为我没长嘴 因为我只靠
实力说话
当笔和beat碰到 像炮弹
这儿根本没人愿意“捧”你 所以你只能靠包“装”
Breaking breaking 连贝壳都被我嚼碎
跟我比？像郭敬明pick的演员，你根本没戏
细胞到海洋霸主 是常人无法承受的裂变
当我经过这水域只剩下人肉的屑片
都说要刷新听众对中文说唱的认知
我按了无数次f5 却还是陈旧的界面
看到这些狗逼OG总是把
他们旧时的友情友谊和有情有义当作楼梯爬
当你走近都可以闻到嘴臭 你快去把你的口气查
当你牛气地用你手指捅进口里 好似狗剔牙
我都不想接班
我的作业还没写完
上首歌的第一段就足够把这儿的屋顶掀翻
三千两买我的verse
我的verse值两千万
但千万的千万别把它给播放在路边摊
有时我会想究竟何时能
好好吃饱一顿 现在我肚子仍
不停叫着 所以我一直等待着大的猎物
我的记忆力不好但是我识人（食人）

可你们的风格是旧的
你搭配是丑的
你吐出的歌词永远变不成gold
When I throw these rhymes, low key fire, OG crying
No jokes, Rest In Peace Kobe Bryant
刚自称第一 你的鼻子就变大象那么长
你马上就知道为啥当我拿起
了笔 小心

我在做的只是往说唱艺术上尿尿啊
有必要这么凶吗 手里咋还拿着铁锹”

20hours仓库里面的Homies全都给我让路
Now get out my way 我根本不用你帮助
走进发现海市蜃楼原来是片荒土
听不懂的人只配回家吃<兰州拉面>
然后给说风凉话的嘴巴们装根拉链
That some 我不需要你监督
我的歌词里有刀小心我戳瞎你的眼珠
和你可以唾弃的时间一样的短暂
我30秒里通过就像经历光速
你出道的名字应该会叫做心惊胆战
听你rap我宁愿回家看李光洙
Now yall play wit the wrong one we hotter than わさび
我承认本以为参加是Show Me The Money
如果不是公司让我参赛都懒得骂你
但你说你是Rapper出租车都不会拉你
我连吴亦凡的脸都没看清就Get Chain
我知道他们和节目组都有约定
但里面我承认的rapper只有15
所以翻唱得再努力你也无法接近
你们还是会说怎么样你还是被淘汰了吧
我想你的脑子应该是被驴踢坏了吧
But its not a Rap Game现在不奇怪了吧
我名字像胶带了吧被我封住要害了吧
Shout to 每一个从上海出发的MC
we the freakin best 这话绝对不是勉励
随便节目怎么安排都不放在眼里
we freak rap of china 是以后共同的简历
但想慰问一下导演 千万别那么累
说谎话非常讨厌 你表情那么fake
很欣赏那些表现 有一半都是gray
他们要踮起脚尖才配看我的表演
看悬崖边上可以开出黄皮肤的花吗
但只要有眼睛都看得出是一场Drama
你们的舞都跳的那么好还需要夸吗
但rap的时候就像是小蝌蚪找妈妈
I cant see HipHop in the C-HipHop
那些*****es和我们是同个级别吗？
哎他们无法拿走我头上的spot light
就像90年的“华仔”
Im always keep it trill real regonize real
满房间的fake ace this is how i feel
最心虚的感觉应该只有他们know
要一个一个推倒 like im playing Dominos

被父母说是最危险的地方 她都去过
今晚演出的rapper 算得上是她最喜欢
她走到吧台 先点了一杯whisky 酸

不甘心只是呆在人群她想挤到后台
在同龄的女生里面 她肯定最会打扮
她和喜欢的男生聊天最烦被人打断

发现 拿起笔时 内心的坎坷经历 有太多要 诉说
窗外冬日里的大雨 落在汽车挡风 玻璃
不停息
熟悉的 加州旅馆旋律 偶尔也被 洗礼
他突然想起 和母亲在 亮马桥
一起喝 辛巴克的 场景
他突然想起 和bro们在
海总生日那天 开错路的 南山之行
还记得，还记得
家门口边 帮着收快递的小卖部里
叔叔阿姨还有老人们的温馨 欢声笑语
转眼之间 日历被撕到了2018 在外第6年
忍耐、等待，期待到惊喜 让人感到澎湃
他没有选择了逃避 选择了抛弃
依旧在 自己建造的这片世外桃源
kickin with the rhythm and timin
他 收起了脾气在这 差不多的年纪
但 从不觉得 道貌岸然比 满嘴脏话来得高贵
偶尔也会 有人来找他 寻求一些安慰
安慰过后不忘加句 有些事情不可言传 只可意会
他苦过累过
但他从来不曾感到困惑
他爱过恨过
但他遇到问题总会歪嘴一笑从而带过
然后轻轻点起一根camel

Verse 1 (Young Nash)

Yalghuz men öy ichide
Uyqu yoq bu këchide
Hennessy muz ichide

Soghuq shamal derizide
Esletti eslimile
Sen yenila yürükümde

Köz aldimda asta asta
Sinariye qayta qayta
Lënta bolup qoyulmaqta

Yamghur yaghmaqchi tëshida
Oylaymen herwaqitta
Qaytip ketsem eng beshigha

Bezide deymen boldila untup këtey hemmini
Lekin qandaqsighimu untup këtimen muhebbetni
Baliliqni ,birge oynap chong bolghan buraderni
Shehirimni kochilarni

Yalghuzluqni xalayma hazir peket
Olturup süküt ichide qilip taket
Ötidu saet qeghez ustige yezip xet
muhabbet azap bilen toshti bet

Ustel ustide ettirgül longqa ichide
Ozgermidi resiming portimal ichide
Künlar ötti ettir gülmu qurup ketti
Yillar ötti senmu yenimdin uchup ketting

Hayat mshundaq toxtimay ötidiken
Axiri yenila özi yalghuz qaldiken
Kaghez qelem ustel ustide xatire
Yezilghini peqet eslima azap iken

Hook (ZBlue)

I hate to say goodbye
Don't you feeling me with no lie
Try to always by your side
Wish u and me a good life

Verse 2(Da Real)

他 披着一件旧的bape hoodie 开始了他的创作
发现 拿起笔时 内心的坎坷经历 有太多要 诉说
窗外冬日里的大雨 落在汽车挡风 玻璃
不停息
熟悉的 加州旅馆旋律 偶尔也被 洗礼

他突然想起 和母亲在 亮马桥
一起喝 星巴克的 场景
他突然想起 和bro们在
海总生日那天 开错路的 南山之行
还记得，还记得
家门口边 帮着收快递的小卖部里
叔叔阿姨还有老人们的温馨 欢声笑语
转眼之间 日历被撕到了2018 在外第6年
忍耐、等待，期待到惊喜 让人感到澎湃
他没有选择了逃避 选择了抛弃
依旧在 自己建造的这片世外桃源
kickin with the rhythm and timing
他 收起了脾气在这 差不多的年纪
但 从不觉得 道貌岸然比 满嘴脏话来得高贵
偶尔也会 有人来找他 寻求一些安慰
安慰过后不忘加句 有些事情不可言传 只可意会
(Ay)苦过累过
但他从来不曾感到困惑
他爱过恨过
但他遇到问题总会歪嘴一笑从而带过
然后轻轻点起一根camel

Verse1 (ZBlue)

看着窗外的夜色已经开始慢慢降临

手中的咖啡杯也逐渐失去了原本的体温

SF的夜里温度还是那么冷

但也只有你的体温能让我如此的兴奋。

灯光闪闪的cable car 在 powell street上游荡

配上你的小酒窝 我心里才是暖洋洋 

大手牵小手走在加州的大街小巷

没有你的日子我实在是无法想象

情侣鞋一双

齐步走向美丽彩虹的方向

看抬起头看， 天空里那橙色的太阳

不停的指引着愚蠢的我们并走向正确的方向

Why you play with my heart and not show love consistently?

You wouldn't take that risk for me

Keep poppin' these pills,
I hope it take away my misery

I hope you grippin' on your gun when them drillers creep
Lil' ***** grabbed his first glizzy,
Went on a killing spree
Caught him at that red light snoozin',
He thought this s**t was sweet
If he come from that other side, we make him rest in peace
I'm way too solid for the gimmicks, **** the industry

If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

I'll never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Tear me up inside, and you break me down

Ah
Guess I'll wait and see
And all my travels seem to bring me back to this place
And all my life i've just been looking for the right way
And i've been thinking to myself that this is who i gotta be
And i've been jivin on my own to find the right pace
And i've been watching all the clocks i need the timeframe
I wonder when will come the day I wonder when i'll see those dreams
I gotta get past that, get out the abstract
I’m writing every thought i think
I’m tryna map that
A little money in my pockets never had that
Just a little though but i been running towards the fat stacks
I been workin all day, all night I watch the sunset
Hues on the horizon got me feeling like it's all set
Calling me to follow so i rap it up like Offset
Even if i didn't it would never leave my conscious
Going oh nani nani
I’m telling you that it's all me
This probably won't be always
But still i won't regret nothing
And if i do then i promise i'll be setting it straight
Yeah i've been getting tired of worrying if i'll make a mistake
I was lost up in a dream where every day was the same
Now everytime the sun rises its a whole other way
I was always playin round now all i do is press play
Turbulence ahead but you know that some risks that you take
I’m like

 Runnin', know they gunnin' 'cause I got the juice
 I been thuggin' since a youngin'
 Brought the work to school
 Floodin' all the hundreds, we done broke the pool
 All this money bring the power out
 And make the rules (Let's go)
 Sipping on codeine got my screws loose
 Making all this money got my screws loose (Yeah)
 Ridin' Lamborgini made her p**sy juicy
 Grippin' on the wheel playin' in her p**sy
 Diamonds my neck been going crazy
 I think I need to see a psychiatrist (Ooh)
 Living in the streets and the gutter raised me
 I know how to sell narcotics (Yeah)
 When they let us off of lock, man
 We gon' make that sh*t pop
 Been humpin' wifey for so long
 She got a limp when she walk
 Got seven drops in four spots
 I get to pick where I live
 In the back they playin' twinsies like a Hugh Hefner zoo
 On my teeth, these diamonds twinkle
 And the legs in jacuzzi (Yeah)
 I be tweakin' every day
 I got some screws missin' (Yeah, yeah)
 I keep an Air Max pump on me, no, not my 270s (Yeah)
 And they know just where I be, it's like I'm 713 (Yeah)
 Havin; money on this side
 It's not the conversation (Yeah, yeah)
 Solitary diamonds, free my dawg inside
 He waiting, yeah (Straight up)
 Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
 With a ***** that's shinin', lookin' like the moon
 Said she wanna party, wanna let it loose
 Bustin' out my back room, she ain't outta loop
 I wanna take care of you and your friends
 Just jump in, let it in (Ooh)
 I put it out, they come in (Ooh, it's lit)

What the fxxk, it's blowing up

I hope this a joke is you really making up
Cause you got me shaking up
Got me fxxking breaking up
Let's think 'bout the good times
You touched so many hearts in such a little amount of time
Ally, I know you want him back and want him by your side
Is this what God wanted, or Satan?
Man, I can't decide
Mama called me
""Please just say something""
""I'm worried like I can't sleep""
I'm sorry Mama but I'm trying to be a better me
I'm sorry Mama but this pressure starting to get to me
For you Mama I'ma try and let the d-rugs free

産声を上げてすぐに迷路
違う性能で共に潜るゲート
一つでも順位をあげようと
蹴落とされた肢体をキラキラと照らすネオン

上手に生きる芸当は笑顔と媚びとヘイト
悪魔とデートしなきゃ手に入らない名誉
子どもの頃教えられた道徳とか法則が
当てにならないのは教えた先生こそ証拠

ほら見ろ枠から外れたあぶれた落ちぶれた
叩かれたくなきゃハナから目立つな喋るなと仕向けた
叩く側に回れば勝ちって正義のバッジを付けた
Bang魔女裁判焦げた網のフレーバー

膨張する同調圧力、常識、被疑者はもう重症
嗚呼、狂信者達よ、ねぇそれなんて新興宗教？
信じたものしか救わない、
否、信じるものすら救わない 神さまに
それでも今日もすがるのさ
ああ有り難い

どうしたらいいの？
ご存知なら何卒ヒントを
リアルを汚す蜃気楼
だとしても何よりの希望

残された呼吸は瞬きはあとどのくらいだ？
毎朝毎晩過ごす時間が処刑台へ上る階段

このムードがいつまで続くか怖くて見てられない
一方通行で来たから落した物すら覚えてない
何を食べて 何吐き出した？
誰かが言う生きてるだけマシだ
人が人を語るなど間違いと人に語る矛盾の谷間

「地獄がどこかもわかりゃしないけれど
ここよりかいくらか生きやすそうだね」と
涙を浮かべたアイツの影を踏み笑う人々がぶつける反吐
病むとか闇こそYum Yum Yummy
何が一体そうさせたのかい？
かく言う僕も変わりゃしない人を裁くなら神に任せたらいい

幸せな生き方のガイダンスとか大体共通する価値観
端から作る神さまにはみ出した迷子の裁判

Guilty？Not Guilty？
まだせいぜい何百万年かの新人
にどうか教えてくれHow we live？

輪になり踊る この街の夜は僕が彩る

今か　今か　待ち侘びた瞬間 開放する自我 たぎる血が循環
掌に感じるMic お前の目の前 ここは通さねえ

我来打头炮 脱下口罩
喷掉假rapper的假头套
太多墙头草两头倒 说话像狗叫
要比real 难道你有强过“一gi我里giao giao”
不要闹 不要让自己变成笑料
要燥 要靠的不止check it out yo yo
Now 是要到我们 同一阵地 整理风气
让那圣光 重新照耀
充满着战意 代表着上海的战力
按惯例清扫那占地挡路的asshole
散发着善意 但我们依然的叛逆
We like传奇的案例 90's Death Row
So 当1SHOT集结 让你分清级别
谁能傲睨一切 而谁只配提鞋
无需理解 带着不屈气节
管他天崩地裂 希望从未熄灭
TK Denzel 比你G
孤矢 颠倒 词比你细腻
土人兒 小酷 帅到炸
如果你也有货 欢迎加入1shot
也请记住别嫉妒
Keyso和Cee技术的密度
你们嘶吼着递进的力度
而我们死守的毕竟是艺术
<土人兒TRE>
又是秀着old school的flow
最dope的bro全都被收进crew
抽了风的小丑们求着我们
手下留情否则asshole们就会哭
Sing a song for 最硬的兵
再沉浸的听着我把经朗诵
Like king kong 不迷路的心
成为金皮肤的马丁路德金
就像是褪色的风铃 还在那追击着声音
它的灵魂依旧never ever sold
So 认同了规则的封印 遵从了faker的踪迹
那些弟弟never enter bro
哪怕碰到淡季了 我们也把Shang Town做大
我们站起了 别的全都双双坐下
那么看戏的也别在叛逆了接着看戏吧
弹夹 不装满子弹 wut you need is 1SHOT
<Don Dream>
我们 一起集中 一起行动
核子意面准备集体启动
你们 一起激动 一起吟诵
因为1SHOT上膛一击即中
进攻 fake gang敲响警钟
Shang Town熟悉音符回响在心中
心动 real man照样精通
海派英雄总会得到听众敬重
这是为什么我们可以代表
我们的名字是城市代号
Flow有着材料 像是海啸
不靠外表 怪叫 将你拍掉
现在排好 别装乖巧
Faggy说唱歌手还想自我抬高
水平太糙 态度太傲
跑到天涯海角都会向你开炮
我们不是匪帮 但还是《说唱传奇》
想要的目标 已超《8英里》的含义
到哪里 还是《All Eyez On Me》
保持《Hustle & Flow》开始1SHOT的传记
<夜吟人(孤矢&颠倒)>
这是孤矢 颠倒 江湖唤作 夜吟人
行文 洒脱 主题包罗万象题材不拘一格 听闻
沪上征召贤能之士 遂怀揣虔诚之志
在此与各路英雄豪杰齐聚共商大计
就在1SHOT大旗 举起之日
布衣踏破屐 本晃荡一方唤名荒诞国
举步皆 乱冈 举目皆 占山为王皆自封梁山泊
(哥哥 不能被招安呐!)
奋笔疾书皆带反骨
盼参悟数十寒暑再演靖康之变
待到登堂入室为博那钦宗关注
桃李芬芳 谈吐间竞相争艳
不愿边做说唱边过着冬
大把银子谁能故作轻松
也别被银两牵制 笔下多坚持
给名利场刮点清风
管你肉林酒色 胸有丘壑什么都兜得住
饮半壶轻酣 醉十里青山 怎么走都是路
有太多外表华丽晃眼 亮过整片星空
但扒开来里面却是空心
所以我们内外兼修不仅要十八种武艺精通
还要满腹珠玑博古通今
无所谓那些所谓的曾经的朋友形同陌路
如今更多兄弟同行
如果要用一句话形容
且看上海滩虎啸龙吟
<Big Denzel>
Mumtombo挡了我前头但是还要冲进去
直接在他头上Tomahawk 拿他当空气
他们都瞪大了眼睛 不敢相信
背后头 挺我的是一帮兄弟
我有点“洋泾浜”但是伐要忘记上海是我的根
Big Denzel把你爆头
pull up choppa马上开始报仇
Turn up like 疯人院 粉丝都
围住我拍照片 真杂劲
都帮我说 我听你歌 赚钞票
Mayweather money team(梅威瑟的公司名)
我说那拿起酒杯 82年Bergendi(勃艮第)我请那喝
这是阿拉的traditional Keyso讲明早再来一客城隍庙生煎包
看着我的 球衣号码 09年的凯尔特人 保罗皮尔斯的关键球
最后一秒 绝不手软打破世界和平防守
pull up with the 3 (干拔三分)
pull up with the G(奔驰大G)
昨天的女孩she so good with the D
Im too different they barely know me
人类总是无法立即包容新的事物
听宋岳庭的话 对我说一定争气
I might not make it but I gotta take it
让我来做厨师 来修复他们 味觉
如果你给我尊重 我一定还你双倍
Ain’t nobody like me then I don’t like nobody
<小酷Coola>
在扣动 板机前我让你 透个气
但没空 再次陪你看作 秀的戏
组成特种部队shout out to Keyso和Cee
就合力 地 秀着技 yeah kill the beat
优 秀的弟 兄在身后
从不参与那些 诱和利 的争斗
所谓的rapper甚至不止六个亿
才几个听众 就得意 又何必 水平真臭
With my team “1SHOT” in Shang Town
我们这次不会 再坐以待毙 不论比 快或比耐力
从不会 半瓶水晃荡
拿下这个胜券 在握的赛季 不借助 太多的外力
当我们 踏上了征途 可能这条路上或许会
面对更多问题赞美 或挤兑
未来到达山顶对待这些选择不去做理会
保持冷静才能看清 错与对
<Cee>
话说 奇不奇怪 意不意外
突然间少了很多“乞丐”
貌似是个rapper就很厉害
在门外 都能排个几排
But Ima Grime MC 开
押“运(韵)”车的老司机 “aight!”
年龄 三十有几
But my flow is tight like virgin type
Be humble kids y’all don’t know me
I keep a low key 像未变形的 Bumblebee
在床头写过的词 多过于你的头屑
为上海滩再 争口气
开口脆 嘴里 藏口技
飞檐走壁 头顶 扛斗笠
有情有义 如果要比江湖气息
那这块金字招牌早已 长久屹立
在Shang Town its my block
从不倚老卖老 我以老带新
像C-block 湘江的麦霸
以flow代“qiang” 击倒“太君”
只用我的说唱盘道
把你的verse丢在桌上完爆
You ready or not 玩笑归玩笑
But last 1SHOT…is for you(blah…)

(嘿，AR) Ay，what's up man
(大家觉得）嗯 ？
(假设你放弃你的歌里所有高级的 punchline 就只凑押韵，你只用一些低级的爆点你就能红）
哦？是吗
(只要押韵了，就算你唱一大堆很一般的东西
并且语句基本通顺，就行了）
真的吗？
(不信你试试看) ok
(先来个十韵怎么样 ？)
12345678910，发出 必杀三次，复仇计划守时
都在 地下办事竖旧 Hip-Hop 手势，玩着 Beatbox，展示户口其他首饰
项链堆积指引，我的魅力自信，帽子压低，就像在对 Jay-Z 致敬
说唱规矩制定，都在嘴里执行，一个押韵太少，我直接给你十韵
跟我兄弟 清晨，做了几个 Shot , 喝口白兰地，
保持 Hip-Hop 精神，说着 Peace and love，磕头拜甘地
我们没有压力，用这首 hot ****，朝对手打击，到最后乏力
如果你仔细听，你会知道我的词，说的毫无意义，但最有押韵
不去那滑稽的 Party 不说那垃圾的话题，你看我的霸气更像 DJ khaled 开着 bugatti 法拉利
我驾驭的 Homie 插旗从，巴西到巴黎，意大利，迈阿密，田纳西卡塔里转纳溪到大理
Versace Versace，我杀你，把押韵都压进你牙龈，把那 Body 挂起打击你像阿里
在这话里有话里有话，在 Bar 里有 Bar 里有 Bar
我太有钱了，哥们儿在我的家里有家里有家
这样说唱，才能被你们听到
加点铺垫，确保你的魅力已尽到
加狠叫着，最后那一句韵脚
这样听众，就直接跪低了晕倒
反正听说唱，就是听押韵
只要没押韵，就是没法听
只要没押韵，就是最差劲
This is what they mean
听说你在将我比较，Fine
但让你看清，Man it's right about time
当他说那 Rap，just all about a lot of rhyme
没人想要听，真正好的 Punchline
But I can’t stand it, boy you outta line
Outta line, baby outta line

这是我的押韵押韵歌，押韵押韵歌，押韵押韵 X 4
我解剖着街头的 Battle 的 Level，再接受并邂逅那 Rap Flow 的写手
我携手，在接受着节奏的 asshole，与猎手在 Ghetto 跟野兽们决斗
你七七八八，叽叽喳喳，噼里啪啦，密密麻麻
叽叽呱呱，hold up
这个叠字押韵停顿真的非常的，嘻嘻哈哈
如果还觉得这些太复杂，学不懂押韵道理
只想简单用个 3 韵，让我立马画饼教你
如果你叫了外卖，等了 1 个多小时
送餐小哥才到，你就可以用这招式
我等你这么久，哥们到底来不来，你在不在，这饭到底卖不卖
他说来了来了，但门开不开，我说你送这么久，哥们该不该
这个服务态度你到底改不改，可他拍了拍手，见怪不怪，
说高峰送餐就这么忙，反正随便你自己爱买不买
做完这些事，你还得编点押韵故事
比如 “哦，我平常积累押韵，几秒就写完一个 verse”
自己自己多有技术，在那 blah blah blah
就连 schoolboy q，也都得 Yawk！Yawk！Yawk！(押押押)
听说你在将我比较，Fine

1488990359,My idol,https://music.163.com/song?id=1488990359,"我以前很烦 我干爷爷给我讲人生态度
他让我不要受世俗摆布 让我把心爱之人留住
对幼小的我来说 我根本就不在乎
然而现在我却有了一些些的感触
他在我心里的表情总是严肃
虽然步履蹒跚 但是眼神像只专注的鹈鹕
他总是跟我讲述那些年的老上海
坐上绿皮火车跑去租界上班
这些故事留下了一张张的胶卷
他总是翻看他相册里那些泛了黄的照片
曾看到过他会望着照片湿润双眼
而淘气的我只是想要趁机藏了他的鞋垫
从有记忆到读高中
我都受到他的教育
他生活虽然艰苦 但厌世
却未曾与他有交集
我庆幸为我书写白纸的人是他
我想成为他卧室口的那幅水墨画
我能做到吗
我慢慢卷起了身体
舒展心情放缓呼吸
缩小成婴儿回归母体
也许只有这样才可以
才可以重新和自己相遇
不想看着家人慢慢老去
下垂的躯体和对抗的自己
你迎着⻛ 笑而不语 朝着我 轻声细语
懵懂的年纪一晃我不再少年
大学之后的我也与他开始 逐渐少见
我把大把的时间塞进音乐
但每次空下来对他都有一丝挂念
物质社会有太多的欲望诱惑着我
更何况那时的我每天都在想着要更火
他对我性格的评价是忠厚老实
这形容词在说唱圈可不算褒义词
那时见他一面都得等到过年
我都27岁了他还在给我红包里面塞钱
我曾努力给他解释我的职业
可他却说 你喜欢就行
不用跟我说这些
那次他在居委会的聚会喝醉摔跤住院
我们全家人都怕他出事轮流守夜
我初次害怕他有天会离开我的身边
你什么时候满头白发的 仿佛 一夜之间
看着你年轻的样子很得意
我的泪
竟然流成小溪
我再一次更深地蜷缩进母体
把自己定格在婴儿的意义
好让你在这个世界多停留一次
这一世你给我的爱
我牢牢记 下一次的轮回里让我们再相聚
知道这个消息时候正在全国巡演
妈妈虽没透露细节但我知道这恐怕是与他的最后一面
伤痛感超出了极限
我推掉商演 然后连夜直奔医院
我看见无力的他正在努力抬起身体俯靠在床沿
声嘶力竭 悲伤的氛围充斥着整个房间
我开始闪回以前与他的争吵
我想道歉 但却没后悔药
这里满是点滴氧气罩
他在努力朝我翻身
我避着他的目光 眼泪实在难忍
清晨 他结束了 病痛与寒冷
那晚我在台上演唱了亲密爱人
北风中的乐队配着蜡烛燃尽了痛苦
雨水冲刷墓碑和那颗杨树
生命到尽头 却也解了你的相思之苦
我会带着你的期待走向我的前路
我慢慢抱紧了身体
我的泪竟然流成小溪
下一次的轮回里让我们再相聚
我想 我不会忘记你
我想 我不会忘记

1452441327,小人物,https://music.163.com/song?id=1452441327,"我不穷也不富 正好是个不折不扣的小人物
有过不服也备受瞩目 高雅又粗俗 最终孤苦地踏进坟墓
从叛逆疾世愤俗变得成熟从来都不认输
在灵魂深处将懦弱根除 人人的经历都是一本书
所有生物 横竖都是死路一条 有些人生无可恋
世事沉浮 谁愿驻足听你陈述与其无关的艰难困苦
上天给我了天赋 说话神速 也许就此安排了我的任务
与内心的恶魔一决胜负 昔日的坏孩子踏上正路
后悔毫无用处 请勿揭开我的痛处
她曾背地里为我恸哭 末路穷途 不堪重负
我是孤僻的哺乳动物 抱歉无法融入群体与他人共处
谁曾与你同甘共苦 风雨同路 要一起大展宏图
因为不满利益的分配而动怒发生冲突
漫长的控诉就仿佛高速公路上的浓雾
一不小心死在中途 生活的烦恼在重复
无人能青春永驻 保持好风度 懂得荣辱
真的功夫绝不是滥竽充数
我相信所有的付出和善良有目共睹
为什么那些不幸的故事能使你我共鸣催人泪下
惧怕未来这般苟且度日 奋力地抓住青春的尾巴
不想活得卑微 不做谁的傀儡 良心不能违背
从不胡作非为 远离是是非非 也不害怕坠毁
我流下了泪水 并不代表颓废
道德是虚无的游戏规则 寂寥的生命是一首悲歌
不是每个问题都有答案 固执的我偏偏以孤独为乐
所有的电影都是为了好奇的人们而慷慨地放映
散场后人去楼空了偶影独游难免又失落和伤心
与光阴共舞 在迷雾中保持清醒 在阳光下闭上眼睛
无需害怕疾病和痛苦 时间自会治愈一切 像雨过天晴
你会从所有的波澜中平复 平躺在一个冰冷的盒子里
而那泥塑的躯体终会归于尘土 结果无可置疑
我们都是出演快乐和坚强的演员
相比之下戏剧里全都是拙劣的表演
那荒诞的爱情就如同生活中的一点消遣
使劲摆出笑脸 看不透的表面 攻不破的谣言 给你贴上标签
数不清的考验 活着就是冒险
万事都有条件 抱歉我听够了抱歉
说爱我的时候平淡无奇 说再见的时刻却又锋利无比
根本懒得哭泣 没人来弥补你 只会替补你
有时感到无力 活着没有目的
像被一双无形的手推到了谷底 上帝无声无息
懂得他故意 苦海一望无际
所以只要还能呼吸就比其他的人更加努力
成长令人猝不及防 没有风怎么会起浪
想摘下虚伪的面具又想披上最适合伪装的衣裳
剩下的时间将要消逝 想要达到期望 是否还有希望
学会了遗忘 提防 抵抗 避让 体谅
有了气量和自我的立场
为什么那些不幸的故事能使你我共鸣催人泪下
惧怕未来这般苟且度日 奋力地抓住青春的尾巴
不想活得卑微 不做谁的傀儡 良心不能违背
从不胡作非为 远离是是非非 也不害怕坠毁
我流下了泪水 并不代表颓废
道德是虚无的游戏规则 寂寥的生命是一首悲歌
不是每个问题都有答案 固执的我偏偏以孤独为乐
所有的电影都是为了好奇的人们而慷慨地放映
散场后人去楼空了偶影独游难免又失落和伤心
你以为我哭了 只不过是在用泪水清洗眼中的沙子
而我微笑的背后那个真实的自己早已经被杀死
收购了你的每句谎言 就像个可笑至极的傻子
我在等的人却不曾等候过我 失去了利用的价值
睁开双眼便是余生的第一天看不到明天我贪生怕死
是否还能像十年前那样意气风发无所畏惧胸怀大志
得不到的东西本来就不属于你 忘了吧 根本不足挂齿
如果时光能够倒流我仍会做出同样的选择对天发誓
鸟折断了翅膀 失去了高飞的欲望 已不在乎风的去向
背井离乡 显得格外凄凉 倍感沮丧 并未如愿以偿
有时我不懂自己寻找的究竟是思想或者一张皮囊
面对迷障 我的迷惘欲盖弥彰 还谈什么远大的理想
无论这个世界有多么的广阔 我只想蜷缩在爱人的角落
尽管那所谓的归宿也可能只是个一戳即破虚幻的泡沫
一只奔跑的蚂蚁无所顾忌坎坷跌宕自然的法则无人能够逃脱
往事不堪回首肩膀布满伤疤哭笑不得直到最后落叶一般地凋落
为什么那些不幸的故事能使你我共鸣催人泪下
惧怕未来这般苟且度日 奋力地抓住青春的尾巴
不想活得卑微 不做谁的傀儡 良心不能违背

1452441322,归人,https://music.163.com/song?id=1452441322,"幸福是被人爱着 有能为之倾尽一生的事
而不幸之人苟且活着 一瞬间恍若隔世
那种无助像被绑着手脚无计可施
挣扎在边缘就连平凡也变得奢侈
噩耗在你毫无防备的时候接踵而至
原本安逸的日子和构想戛然而止
为何如此安排 我们从来不得而知
难以阻止将发生的事 情绪失控难以克制
确诊报告让我一度怀疑被命运误判
世间的种种障碍也逐渐云消雾散
我宁愿孤单 不想成为任何人的负担
似乎所有的繁华都已经与我无关
生很艰难 死很简单 将名利情权看淡
人生真实而又惨淡 如何才能坦然
长夜漫漫 窗外的世界依旧灯火阑珊
无论今夜有多辗转 明天阳光依然灿烂
I'm the whisper of the leaves
And the anger of the sea
Not a traitor to a person or memory
One day we'll be together
Lord will set me free
I was blind but now I can see

辛苦争取获得的一切都无法带走
即便被逼到寸步难行仍要挺胸抬头
有些话憋了太久 早已经无从开口
无人能够分享我的喜怒哀愁
此时才感觉自己在世上无足轻重
不希望有人因为我的病痛而悲悯心痛
或许痛苦是人们轻生唯一的理由
我不愿带着愧疚死去 不想有所遗留
不知道是对药物还是自身感到恶心
我们蒙蔽了双眼只有旁观者清
所有灰色的过去都是我不可缺少的部分
接受与否 那是让生命完整的组成
在最困苦的时期才能认清自己是谁
没想到在绝境之中学会了辨明是非
嘲笑着无为的岁月和世俗的金迷纸醉
在上帝的眼里我也不过是个无名之辈
I'm the whisper of the leaves
And the anger of the sea
Not a traitor to a person or memory
One day we'll be together
Lord will set me free
I was blind but now I can see

每个生命都要经历鲜活和腐烂
追求着永恒 远离疑惑和苦难
生者皆为过客 死者都是归人
就像空中扬起之后又飘落的灰尘
每个生命都要经历鲜活和腐烂
追求着永恒 远离疑惑和苦难
生者皆为过客 死者都是归人
就像空中扬起之后又飘落的灰尘
I'm the whisper of the leaves

Not a traitor to a person or memory

1365879188,孤独症患者,https://music.163.com/song?id=1365879188,"终会有一天 我不得不离去
带走此生所有的记忆
如果忘记过去意味着新的开始
我愿意重新做个初生的孩子
没有人看得见我就算他们都睁着眼睛
互相擦肩而过 盲目活着也没有原因
复制和重复着同样的言行
就像每天都在放映着同一部电影
我是个孤独症患者 天空不再是蓝色
那双隐形的翅膀已经折断了
那些在我难过的时候听过的歌
成了我最好的朋友总是难以割舍
是世人太冷漠还是我想得太多
连自己的影子也开始出卖我
它喜欢和别人的背影重叠在一起
仿佛对它们倾诉着藏在心底的秘密
不需要谁记得 我是个孤独者
就算被这个世界遗忘那又如何
无人喝彩和安慰 我承认我输了
就像被孤立的孩子 他伤心地哭了
不需要谁记得 我是个孤独者
就算被这个世界遗忘那又如何
无人喝彩和安慰 我承认我输了
就像被孤立的孩子 他伤心地哭了
人们庆祝着生日许下美好的愿望
转瞬即逝的烛光映在欢笑的脸上
总有人试图忘记自己出生的日期
和我一样期待一场彻底的失忆
你还有多少年可以用梦想欺骗自己
被那些没有答案的问题困扰到窒息
为了逃避那段往事去过很多个地方
每当陷入抑郁的情绪依靠药片来抵抗
不知道想要什么早已放任了理想
原来时隔多年后我仍然会感到迷茫
如果错误可以被原谅让我痛改前非
如果裂痕可以愈合让我重新面对
也许我会和他们一样快乐
找到一个人毫无保留地爱着
和一群同样孤独的人在一起互相舔舐伤口
就算明白这是伪装也舍不得放手
我所有的感情像一个尘封的盒子
窗外的身影是那些成群的鸽子
闹钟一直在响我却从未听到
直到有一天它死去时间也未曾警告
慢慢地忘了自己是谁消失在影子里
当黑夜来临之时我也终将逝去
一个人的世界让我如此痴迷
我爱上了孤独不需要谁来治愈
不需要谁记得 我是个孤独者
就算被这个世界遗忘那又如何
无人喝彩和安慰 我承认我输了
就像被孤立的孩子 他伤心地哭了
不需要谁记得 我是个孤独者
就算被这个世界遗忘那又如何

我依旧是个路人至今还没火过
拥挤的人群让我有些恶心
大家都有血有肉却又参差不齐
我想起那时和妈妈还在争执
那些噩梦的日子渐渐远去
这世界人人都在丰富自己简历
而艺术却被电视台给层层剪辑
我对这些嘴脸 早就已经自我免疫
Yo pac和biggie
在你那里是否已经何解
我的兄弟何立 在你那里
是否把毒给戒了****
听说天堂能满足人一切
有时我也挺想要早点去世
可惜我手上正有 一张绝世专辑
我还有很多心里话 没对我听众谈及
所以我才不会轻易死去
能坐火车尽量不上飞机
得去医院尽量 别在家人面前装逼
记得 那时连我的前女友 都在劝我放弃
哼 她才不懂我的战斗动机
我有耶稣般的使命
这些拜金狗显然需要 我的指引
这世上不该只有一个宋岳庭
上帝我对你发誓
我要登上人物杂志
让我的家人不再 为我眼角打湿
我怀念我外公 可美好总得随风逝去
我期待你能读懂文字游戏 成为我的知己
搭上我肩膀 手机打开你的前置
在我写完圣经之后 我将安详逝世
不过现在即使闪电 也没法将我劈死
上帝之子还没完成 神给他派发的旨意
这首是向体制宣战的导火管
为了小学我爸给我做的那款泡沫板
泳池管理让我们 滚出去说这东西会把水污染
他不知道我爸用捡破烂的泡沫 刻了一晚
我会永远记得贫穷 带给人的遗憾
当然也绝不可能会因为 物质而变的糜烂
闭上你的嘴巴 不必给我评判
难道我该乞求有人能够为我颁发一个负能量奖？
你是否能够明白  脏话背后传递的伟大思想
我要的不是月入千万而是受到万人敬仰
我是黎明来临前的最后一个战将
夕阳来幕之时我将追随上帝飞向天堂
 我向上不停飞 直到照亮千山万水
我向上不停飞 直到可以触碰天堂
我向上不停飞 直到照亮千山万水
我向上不停飞 直到可以触碰天堂

但当你使用我的歌曲还必须给我分钱
当我说要跟你网恋我们肯定不会奔现
当我敷完面膜 女友粉们就像是来到春天
我最近心情不好
感觉好像住在孤岛
因为新人根本就不知道谁是鼠尾草
我要在你们聚会时吃光你们啃老买的蛏子

该做就做否则独留长恨
点燃烽火台由我率先开打
爬上长城看看土地有多大
我们早晚靠着麦克把这里称霸
太多MC还在地下努力挣扎
不管我走多远也不做睁眼瞎

我是蟑螂恶霸每天横行霸道

hook
那高中你写的信 我读的很用力
tattoo怪我的身体来不及拉住你
慢节奏的我 错像没钥匙的锁
wu～ please dont go
衣柜里你的睡衣什么时候来取
电话冰冷的语气眼睛要深呼吸
慢节奏的我 错像没钥匙的锁
wu～ please dont go

你要我给你自由 我像孤鸟在枝头
这次算我失手 心没法像块石头

下一站在东塘下 你为我剪短中长发
带你去兜风 去球鞋店打工 风华正茂疯狂吧

verse 1
从遇见到say hi 从热恋到分开
你努力融入我的生活却对你坏
几年了那么久 像走到了路口
你选择做朋友从此就要离开

一个人路慢走 拥挤的出站口
我低头穿过人群 都是悲伤题材
半夜里睡不着 心碎你听不到
窗外大雨是我夜晚伪装的迷彩

那时候还没有成名 朋友没三五成群
理想还没有成形 还不敢按你家的门铃
还说院子里要挂风铃 晴天娃娃送你
眼泪飘在风里 离家还没有160公里

还不知道 就再也碰不到
从前在乎 的事都不重要
翻开旧的信件 不流行的明信片
用青春来祭奠 用这首歌作纪念

hook
那高中你写的信 我读的很用力
tattoo怪我的身体来不及拉住你

verse 2
恍惚的十一月 窗外雨湿一夜
我写进诗里面 被泪水打湿一页
一晃又是几年 回忆不知期限
伤口得自己舔 你说雨后又是晴天

有时会对自己怀疑 想隐姓埋名
生活过得还行 不用管油盐柴米
刷新街头的排名
新level来临 冷风突然来袭 这感觉还行

曾经想跳过的生活开始想念 也许是因为你 也许这就是青春 年幼的心声
当年的风度不减 往事浮现
定格的时空故事是你主演 烟雾消失不见

不知不觉 彻夜不眠 很多事产生误解
你觉得肤浅 你觉得不解 愁眉苦脸 我敷衍
我觉得不屑
就跟着鼓点
让这首歌再继续为你哭脸

hook
那高中你写的信 我读的很用力
tattoo怪我的身体来不及拉住你
慢节奏的我 错像没钥匙的锁
wu～ please dont go
衣柜里你的睡衣什么时候来取
电话冰冷的语气眼睛要深呼吸
慢节奏的我 错像没钥匙的锁
wu～ please dont go

好想时间冻结 只剩下我和你
你说世界终结不过失去我而已
一起读的中学 讨厌变黄的枫叶
想给你一切用往后一生锁着你
hey babygirl 梨花头
hey babygirl can't let it go
在梦里头 hey babygirl 你不要走
hey babygirl  无所谓咯

月光缠绕你的发梢 你依旧虔诚的祈祷
祈祷着明天依旧美好

Walking on my way
我能看到远处闪着光辉
Go man
穿越这片沙漠直到Woken Day
当我睁开我的眼睛
褪去了斑驳 袒露脆落的心
析出 的结晶 接近 与 你我之间
相连 的海岸线 伴随着我们的断点
串联 在这个世界 我们迎接 最后光艳
况且 沉睡间我听到你们的呼唤
陪伴 在孑然的我重生的梦幻
共患难因为我们同船
目标是通关
羽翼渐丰满
Wokenday虎踞龙盘
这没有沙雕 除了法老是个麻烦
八贼站船头喂鸽子 Viito在船尾划船
龙崎和杨和苏被小李灌醉吐了一地
雷迪喊教授快来制止这种不良习气
和隆隆享受福利骑着狐狸兜到西湖去

我不停不停前进 无比的幸运
年少多斤 来看看我们多拼
一切从心 灵魂跟着beat共鸣
24/7 状态在线从不懈怠
法老和八贼都对我的混音速度感到意外
不满足躲在幕后像个技术宅
我唱了几句rap 跟WalkingDead的兄弟们上台
对不住了兄弟们
我最后一个写好verse
怎么又是香肠派对？
没有女孩子的份儿
我答应你们这个夏天 会拿到冠军
在漫天繁星下加冕 的君士坦丁
虽然这路上很多人不淡定 老犯病
但让他们自己去反省 别再对牛弹琴
快干了这碗庆功酒 才会有干劲
跟我迎风走 爬到这座山顶 ya
Shout out to 我背后牢靠的队伍
再堵上他们唠叨的嘴 woo

和Woken Day的兄弟走在一起吹响号角
不在乎fame、fake流量
也不在乎钞票
我不是针对 所有lame三脚猫
只因为我们忠、义、孝
inside the blood vessels
Got the spirit从头一直到脚
With my crew,
We will get‘em all the gold medals
Work harder 总有一天成为他们骄傲
那个高调的八哥
不再暴躁了
下个目标找到了
糟糕和老套的想法全都烧掉了
悄悄的成长 跑道上疯狂咆哮的跑着
结局早就被我料到
进化的太快 不再想逃跑
不再被束缚 挣脱了镣铐
A team like us可不好找
我骄傲我身在这牢靠的队伍
着调的兄弟伙有多少的高招给你们瞧瞧
在一片荒芜的废土中建立起堡垒
那时候我们还是刚出征的小鬼
Building my ghetto team
They wanna follow me
最后的胜利之前行动没有懊悔
扛过了一场场的痛苦我们变得更强
燃烧的烈火终将把菜鸟炼成一只凤凰
如果说末日浩劫正在来临就在这时
那我大脑的伤口流出的是我的歌词
我还是那个fake hiphop爱去网吧
我还是那个fake hiphop住你楼下
您吃了吗？
我的电瓶在小镇开的特别慢
载着穿着洛丽塔的卡特曼
我爱咸菜面里加个蛋
如果你不喜欢也得看着办
穷到每周一都停机
傻的没能力玩心机
喝到互相练习英语听力
地毯上是谁留下的脚气？
我罚你扫地

建立了活死人
从没想过我会走到如今这地步
也许要感谢神
我已经是个退了休的过气主理人
我看着星星之火一点点的烧起这座城
这些年我们树敌无数
却从没思考过为何我们总是如此孤独
但我知道 我并不无辜
都是自作自受
每次反省都在事后
我靠丧失了一大群的朋友
来换来了这份成就
每次打开手机
满世界的压力让我无法呼吸
大家都是这么看我
他们在说我很虚伪根本不像歌词里的那般对名利淡泊
觉得我把团队变得善于炒作
购买热搜等等言论到处散播
粉丝抱团倒戈 而我心里如同刀割
每当看见了这些评论 我只是醉卧家里
迷失于一段段的回忆
我反复的问着我的猫咪
“现在真的是说唱的时代么”
“我是成功还是失败了？”
而它只是依偎在我的身旁就会很快乐
梦被你烧破 我 我飞蛾扑火
Please please don't kill me
看着听着 听着说着痛着痛着 哭了
于是媒体开始让我背锅
我只发了个表情他们说我退博
当我继续发博他们说我该被掌掴
不过我无力反驳
因为说多就会错多
而有人正在等着我犯错
成名所换来的折磨
只能苟且着得过且过
而我不是唯一的受害者
那天巡演成都站
我看见buzzy流泪了
他说“我就像个蠢蛋
唱一样的歌
说一样的话
像个机器人不快乐”
我又何尝不是如此，
我好想找个角落永远待着
但此刻我得学会做个哥哥
我们以此为生
肩负一身责任
我已不只代表一个人
我扛起他肩膀把他带出大门
线帽遮住了他的泪痕
粉丝们不解的望着我们
空气中夹杂着笑声
没人知道我心中有多闷
我
已经坚持不下去了
连手臂都抬不起了
却得接着再打五个回合
而对手不止几个
包里放着安眠药片
还有四份账单等着我交钱
我站在舞台成为焦点
努力的挤出了一张笑脸
梦被你烧破 我 我飞蛾扑火
Please please don't kill me
看着听着 听着说着痛着痛着 哭了

我很乖啦 没有再闹啦
也没有跟他们提到你啦
我想过一千遍一万遍我们在一起的样子
又觉得这辈子都不要和你在一起
我不会再愚蠢的发誓天荒地老
就像雨滴渗透地表
带你去的每个地方都标了记号
让你飞吧就像一只脱笼之鸟
飞到我怀里我陪你我给你合理的规矩
保护你抱着你靠着你下起了暴雨
躲进我的外套里我不会丢掉你
搞笑的祷告想要找到你
可我永远不会知道
暴雨能把谁给毁掉
对着大地肆意咆哮着
我渺小的不能逃掉了
天色变暗大雨就来
乌云和绝望并排
他们看着我幸灾乐祸
但我倔强的不肯离开

快点走吧赶紧离开
别让我看到你的背影
还有什么遗憾没别的好说
沉醉在这梦里我不会醒
那些失落的难过的消极的情绪把我包围
那些甜蜜的愉快的温暖的回忆把他烧毁
想时光倒退以后再拨通你的电话号码可能
会太冒昧
Hey I don't care
你说过的话和承诺Idon't care
你再去牵谁的手Idon't care
只剩暴雨和我lam here
不想再怎么说怎么做已经断了联络
想删掉手机号码和其他联系方式不再留下线索
矛盾的我像个贱货
回想你说的爱我是不是骗我
Yeah 还是算了吧
你我之间的到此为止联系断了吧
以后我的心里不会这么乱了吧
我们身边的人也该换了吧
我还回忆陪你的时光是多么美妙
现在唯一剩我在这拾荒
再也回不去过去的轨道
闭上眼睛浮现的又是你的微笑

Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like You
Tryin' not to quench Your fire with the things I do
I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded
Low key and stayin' candid
Reflect on all the things I try my hand at
Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
A mountainous fountain
Spinnin' and monsoonin', grinnin' it's high octane
Explosive how I came
Rollin' down hills 'cause life's a hassle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat, catch a second wind
Thin is the air I breathe

The joy of new birth and the pain of growin' up
The bliss between givin' my all and givin' up
The highs and lows
Paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze
Tryin' to ease my woes
In this world of sin
Clothes too thin to fend
So to God I send
Words of help to win
In grumblings so deep letters could never express
So the sound of Ooh Aah beneath my breath projects

And I believe in the Kingdom Coming
I believe if You seek the truth
You don't need to look far 'cause it's gonna find you
So why oh why do I trip and stumble?
And ooh aah as commitment crumbles?
I can't believe that I'm here again....
My life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord if You see me please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price You paid
Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like You
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do
It's times like these that make me say

What would your last words be?
If someone put a gun to your head
And said you had two minutes before they shoot
Here are mine
Wish I can go and revisit the evil
I did through the course of my life (I wish)
Wish I could go back in time take the wrongs
That I did and reverse them to right (****)
Wish I can take all the pain, the hurt,
The struggle and keep 'em inside (Damn)
Wish I can say that I'm sorry to people
I broke here before that I die (What)
Wish I can go back in time to my father,
I didn't really mean it
Wish I can go tell my mom that I loved her,
And all of this money I got I don't need it
Wish I could go to the church and I talked to the Lord
In an effort to conquer my demons
I'm beggin' and pleadin', I'm down on my knees
And he's ready to shoot and I'm practically bleedin'
So this is my destiny, I finna get death to the G
Somebody please help me, yeah
These are my last words
It's Dax!
Wish I can go back in time
And revisit myself just to make me believe
I had these goals and these dreams in my mind
That were mine that I'll never achieve
All of these gifts and these talents were given by God
I was blessed to receive
I was too busy worry 'bout *******
And money and all of this **** that you people would think
Needed help with depression,
All of my passive aggressions
I should've confessed them
I learned my lesson,
I didn't get nothin' but sadness
That ****** over all of my blessings
******* perfection
I shoulda walked on my own
And I traveled the common direction, just to be trending
Just to be trending!
Wish I woulda not held back
Wish I woulda not felt bad
Wish I woulda hugged my dad
Wish I woulda ****** that ***** when I had that chance
Wish I woulda sold my soul
Just to get fame and all
Shoulda played basketball
***** was masterful
Wait!
Wish I would have never put my time into those people
Who never tried to give it to me back
Wish I would have never put my heart into a woman
That will break it than allow it just to have a second chance
Wish I would have let 'em see
What I was really dealing with, instead of tryna
Hide it on a ************' track
I blow a milli just to prove that I'm a legend
In the makin' just to show them
What it looks like when I get it right back
These are my last, my last words
Dear God
I'm not gonna lie, I'ma need your forgiveness
I knew that no one was watching but in my last minutes
I now know that you were a witness
So I'm repentant
Now that's it's sinnin'
Why? Because I need to make it to heaven
Born as a sinner, die as a winner
Period just like the end of a sentence
I swear the devil is watching me
He tried to make me his prodigy
This is my ******* apology
I don't want nothin' but honesty
Heaven to hell was just callin' me
30 seconds left
These are my last words
And to the ***** that broke my heart
I just hope that you can sleep
Knowing every single man you'll meet will never be like me
You can run, you can hide
But you will see me in your dreams
On TV
It's Dax!
Wish I can go back in time to my father,
I didn't really mean it
Wish I can go tell my mom that I loved her,
And all of this money I got I don't need it
Wish I could go to the church and I talked to the Lord
In an effort to conquer my demons
I'm beggin' and pleadin', I'm down on my knees
And he's ready to shoot and I'm practically bleedin'
So this is my destiny, I finna get death to the G

Dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean

You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage but haters say Dre fell off

They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed they want to know how I feel about it
If you ain't up on pace

Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease

Treat my rap like Cali **** I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A M compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat

It's Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin' Cru

Remember that you promise me
You won’t be a gangsta no more
Сулшай мой сонг мафиози,
Как пациент при гипнозе.
Я тебе солью в рэп-прозе,
Будто я вотерклозет.
Легенда для миллионов, как будто Дон Корлеоне,
Бросаю в бой легионы слов как Наполеон.
Ваши текста от беса.
И не имеют веса
Я говорю вам честно
Ваша цена полпесо.
Я написал этот трек, чтобы каждый знал кто тут рэп,
Слушал его, впредь сел на него, как будто это крэк.
Это мой гангста-рэп
Потому что вне закона,
Это мой гангста-рэп
Для эфира запрещенный,
Это мой гангста-рэп
Для моих окраин и районов.

You won’t be a gangsta no more
Снизу как андерграунд,
я начал боди каунт
и для тебя сейчас
это последний раунд
и если хочешь, зови меня киллер, я напрягаю, как триллер
делаю изи мани будто наркодилер.
Грозный как коза ностра,
С рифмами как у монстра.
Будто сошёл к вам с постера
Жгу будто перец остро
Я написал этот трек, чтобы забрать ваш хлеб, будто я Поль Брег
И снится по ночам вам, словно шрек.
Это мой гангста-рэп,
Потому что неформат
Это мой гангста-рэп,
Потому что жжёт без мата,
Это мой гангста-рэп,
Потому, что всё в нём правда, братка
Only money in the world

Это  мой гангста-рэп
You won ’t be a gangsta no more
Кто сказал рэп это поза,
Для пацанов без мозга?
Я начитаю с форсом.
но не играю в босса.
Я не хочу попасть тебе в плэйлист,.
Я хочу, чтоб каждый мой релиз, каждый диск, трахнул шоу-биз
Помню я взял микрофон,
Помню, я стал игроком
И не жалел ни о чём.
будто я Аль Капон.
И кулаками как в ринге я строю вас будто Кинг
Это мой трек-ассасин, это мой гэнгста-дрим.
Это мой гангста-рэп
Потому, что он от боли
Это мой гангста-рэп
Что не ищет лёгкой доли
Это мой гангста-рэп,
Он как я не может жить без воли.
Only money in the world

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that
Get back you'll never see daylight, If I'm not strong, it just might

They figure me a dead ************, but I'm just a ************ that want to be dead
Snow leopard with the lead in his head
Turning me into a sweater
******* use me as their ******* bedspread
I be the silouhette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights makes me violent
I'm trying to get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage
Black hole in my chest
Big bang
Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head it feels like I'm a guest so I will throw it all away because when I am dead I will be nothing  decomposing in a grave
I'm matter but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain spattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve
Going to have to paint it all

Always boasting my emotions
On how I'm so ******* broken
Think I'm joking
When I'm talking
About blowing my head open
Till the moment you walk in
And find my body motionless
Wrists slit
Thoughts of $lick keep falling in an open pit
****
Always burn my bridges
Cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches
Then my **** has been the biggest
And my goal's to **** the world
Until that ************'s twitching
Lane switchin'
Same mission
To die and blame my addiction

Trying to see the signs
that would tell me that what I'm doing is actually right
But I can't even see a strimmer of light
But I'll never quit this fight
Even though no one seems to believe in my ability
to take flight into the stars
But one day I'll get there I swear
But have to admit that it's difficult
not to feel down when people keep chanting insults
like a freakin' cult
And some times when I was trying to fly
It felt like I was about to die
And I have to confess that at some times I actually felt really depressed
And thinking about ending it all with a final fall
But then I met someone new
A man with a similar plan
And we decided to collab
We made something great and some day
They'll see the things I built from the ground up to the sky
They'll see me standing on that stage
Having the people cheering my name
And I'll be building greater things

And no matter what stands in my way
It won't stop me from hearing them say
That I won't make it big
But I'll tell you this that I don't get bothered by tiny little pigs
They try to burn down my forest of beliefs
But all they break is a pair of twigs
But to be honest I didn't always think like this
I used to think that my music wasn't worth ****
But now I know that my broken wings aren't something to be ashamed for
They just let conquer and be more
More than what I ever was before
Making sure I escape my twisted fate
And enable me to finally feel great
For a long time I never thought that I'd amount to anything
But now I finally realize I can do just about anything
Anything and everything I put my mind too
But it takes a little bit of faith
And you got to make sure you never hit the breaks
'cause if you do then you'll never reach the skies
And you'll never learn how to fly on your (broken wings)

Fried hard with the ***********' fries, *****
(Aye, did the J-Kwon vocals come in yet, bruh?)
JD, do you love Smi?
Are you riding?
That Suzuki love, ain't doing no motorcycling
I'm like, ""Hol' up""
Need some roll up
Like I'm big worm pull up in the ice cream
Go to my ends
Where it begins
Get a signal like the wifi get you loudin'
'Fore you slide in
I'm a fat kid
Throw the cake and licky lick off all the icing
I gotta change
I got a chain
Diamonds very Venus VVS
Tennis necklace stank
And they dance like Tina Turner
Heard my name been ringing a bell
Made it sing like Patti LaBelle
Lose her voice like shawty Adele
She want that computer love
I said, '*****, go get you a Dell'
I'm a MAC, I'm a pro
In Wisconsin, I'm at the Dells
She feel like she Earnhardt
Crashin' out
I'm feelin' like Dale
All we do is burn spark
Conversations turn into dust
Now we used to, hold on
Trap Money Smino (Hello)
I buy you Valentino
Pop you like some Pringles
Deeper than a sea, guhl
Flew in like a seagull
Once you get a Mike, can't never **** a Tito
Do you love Smi?
Is you riding?
Used to being alone
Can I borrow some time and
Come and find me
Northside and
'Cause I move that 'caine like he Ron, no Isley
No advisin'
Ain't no guidin'
Gotta get it
And it's only 'bout providing

My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So f*ck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got s**t to say (Say)
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I can save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't f*ck with me tonight
Said you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it

I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My heart gets  possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' a  fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie like doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one the unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my ****** slidin' (Slidin')
I'm ******' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')

I can't be the only—
Yeah, does anybody feel like me?
Show of hands, I don't need a lot, I just wanna find my peace
Yeah, why you throwin’ rocks, oh, you wanna kill my dreams?
Okay, tell me everything I'm not
You think I didn't know those things?
Always been a little lost and I still might be
Life's hard, but it's okay (It's okay)
Watchin' the comments feels like I'm at a court date
How could I complain
With a house like this and a car like that in the driveway?
Half of what I say
Kinda feels like a dream that I’m gonna wake from someday
Wishin’ that I'd pray
A little more often and put more time into my faith
Travel in my brain, woo, might find damage and no grace
Things that I hold on to, but I won’t say things that I won't let go
So I chain my soul to the heartbreak
Havin' a nice day, that's not a average in my case
Don’t like cameras in my face; glamour, it's all fake
Love my job, but it might seem odd that I'm here 'cause I hate fame
Yeah, pay my debt to me, throwin' threats at me
They can't tell, disconnectin' me, it's affectin' me
Hide that well, they'll write checks to me, but don't check on me
By myself, always questioning what comes next for me
I can't be the only—
No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only—
Yeah, if you made a list of people that you trusted would you put your name down?
Do you know who you are when you look at life and you talk about yours, do you feel proud?
Are you leaving a mark, or scared to make a bad impression so you just go hide in the dark?
Livin' and playin' a part, knowin' regret'll come back up tomorrow
That's what it does, ain't it? Don't know what we're chasin', but we all do it
Just a part of life, I guess we're all foolish
Running after what we think will make us happy 'til it falls through
And then we find out later it ain't what we wanted
So we give up on it, then we pile the garbage
And we watch it grow and find a drug and numb it
'Til we hit the point that we can barely function
Am I motivated? Is my music dated?
Would I be the same if I was medicated?
Even therapists say I need medication
I avoid it, though, because I'm scared to take it
Am I the only one that has a loaded gun
That's full of doubts and memories to overcome?
And I complain about 'em when they shoot at me
But I know truthfully I like to load 'em up and let 'em—
That's so sad to see, that's so sad to see, I need help
They talk passively, then come after me by myself
Lost that half of me, God, there has to be someone else
Don't feel bad for me, I just can't believe that I'm lonely
No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only—
There's gotta be somebody out there
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
Who needs company, and it's comforting to know
There's gotta be somebody out there
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
Who needs company, and it's comforting to know
I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I (I) can't be the only— (Only)
Can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I (I) can't be the only—

When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off 'til you
Scream piss off screw you
When it talks to you like you don't belong or tells you
You're in the wrong field
When's something's in your mitochondrial
Cause it latched on to you like
Knock knock, let the devil in malevolent
As I've ever been, head is spinnin' and this medicine
Screaming, le le le let us in
Li Li Li like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bed ridden, should've been dead a long time ago
Liquid tylenol, gelatin think my skeletons melting
Wicked, I get all high when I think i've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure
Hell, I meant Kahlúa, screw it, to hell with it
I went through hell with accelerance and blew up myself again
Volkswagen, talespiin
Bucket matches my pale skin, medal win
Went from Hellmann's and being rail thin, Filet-o-Fish
Scribbles and Rap Olympics 97 Freaknik
Like your web and you just caught in 'em
Proof's room slept on floor of the, motel then
Dr. Dre said hell yeah
And i got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And i know they're gonna hate but i don't care, I
Barely could wait to hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this ****** world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p pellets in the felt pin
C**ked, **** around and catch a hot one
I I, It's evident i'm not done
V-Venomous, the thought spun like your web
And you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hub cap or a mud flap
Be strangled or attacked
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, **** a blood track
Like what's her name at the wheel
Danica Patrick
Through the car into reverse at the end of the nut ration
And you look back and it's just mangled steele
My Mustang and Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be the combination of an actual kamikaze, and Ghandi
Translation I will, probably kills us both when I end up
Back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the ***** happened
End of ya, when you're bit with the

On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a symbiote so
My fangs are in your throat, hoe
You're steppin with my
Venom
Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun c**k, bump stock, devil eye, buck shot
Tied her up to a garrote
Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught
Fire juggerknot, punk rock, b*****s going down like Yung Joc
Cause the Doc, put me on like sun block
Why the **** not
You only get one shot
Ate s**t 'til i can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And i wait with a headache and i take anything in
Rectuangular shape, then I wait
And I take anthing in rectangular shape
Cause they're chasing me but i'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I'ma latch on you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents life
And your childhood too
Cause if i'm the music yall grew up
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the supervillain, dad and mom were losing their marbles to
You marvel that, Eddie Brock is you
And i'm the suit, so call me

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh, I love the way you lie
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh, I love the way you lie, oh
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories
This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me You're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each others backs
That we'll have each others backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts but I refused counselin'
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't **** you can do about it
With you I'm in my ******' mind, without you, I'm out it
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

Reload and shoot for the stars, y'all look like astronomy
No one as hot as me, copy me commonly
Wannabes, y'all are so shockingly comedy
Carry the weight of my songs all on top of me
I will not break I'm not made out of pottery
Bury your bodies on acres of property
Place them at angles like sacred geometry
Down with modesty
Everything I drop is quality
Promise, like honestly, follow me
I ain't gonna stop with the hits
Come rock with the kid
Unlock like Pac woulda been
I'm a god with the pen, no cops at the crib
Got guap 'cause I'm awesome at this
Underrated, overpaid, they hate it
Complicated calculations made to rape the paper
Razor-sharp like blades and Freddy versus Jason
Angels in my heart and Satan in the basement
Raisin' hands and faces what has made me famous
Great imagination, fatal combination
Labels holler daily, I've been on vacation
Sorry I got a point of view
It's like a pistol, you don't want the point at you
Y'all are annoyin', dude
Y'all are like rats racin' in a gas-chamber
Y'all can't avoid the fumes
Y'all in a cage locked
My deranged thoughts are like Ray Charles
Waving chainsaws cause yo' brain chopped
Into 8 parts, take yo' face off
Hit the graveyard on my days off
I just cock, aim, and I spray shots
'Til yo' legs lock and your veins pop
In a day's break y'all get laid off
My girl shot every single ****in' video
My heart wrote every single ****in' song
Y'all aren't my children my kids would be indigo
Obviously I'm a ****in' god
Rock with me, awfully cocky
Cock at the goblin, shotgun and coffee
Slaughtering lots and I'm offering coffins
To anyone caught talkin' sloppy about me, yeah
Come rock with the kid
Young, poppin' and rich
Got dollars, I'm coppin' the drip
I'm downing the armour and authoring honour
While bombing the targets that karma has missed, hey
Y'all don't comprehend I'm often on the mend
I'm depressed a lot, I've wrecked a lot of people who were friends
I've been anxious, I've had breakdowns that were all inside my head
I regret a lot of things now I won't stop 'til I'm avenged
Knock knock, who's there?
Y'all ****ed around and let death in
I'm John Lennon, I'm Michael Jackson
I'm Cobain, I'm Zeppelin
Your best friends are dead ends
Your best bets are far-fetched
You're next-best, I'm a gold trophy
Your death-threats were ghost stories

Nothing is impossible
It's Dax!
You ready
I gave up hooping for these rapping ways
I told my momma we’d see better days
I’m going hard like when I m********e
I Guess I never passed the age
I remember days I didn’t pray
and now I’m on my knees that s**t was just a phase
I Garnered fame but I ain't never changed
They say I’m humble but they didn’t know  I’m staring death right in the face
Forcing me to calculate
think 'bout every move I make
They could never take me
I’m a guardian of heaven's gate
Now I’m here to captivate
Moving at a rapid pace
Nothing into something now
it’s Dax the one they can’t erase
Seperating fame from actuality I navigate while moving through a sea
Pessimistic people that are fake
Imitate
Innovate
Educate
Infultrate
Separate
I navigate while moving through a sea
Segregate
All just to accelerate
A path that I was destined on to walk
and I refuse to wait for someone else to crown
so I named myself the heavyweight
CHAMPION
If I get knocked off I will be back again
Those who didn’t believe
I closed my eyes and turned my back on them
Speaking mediocrity
Don’t understand like mandarine
So if it ain't success man
I ain't picking up or answering
I'm the one who put myself here
I’m the one who told the devil **** off
It’s only god I fear
I’m one who put the stars into alignment
Had a Dream
And then collided it with work
And then I named it perfect timing
I’m the one that fell down
bounced back
relapsed
got lapped
reclassed
but never fell off track
Fighting demons in the evening overnight
while I was cleaning $7.25 an hour
was the wage no cap
I am definition
I don’t lack skill
I lack recognition
I don’t have dreams
I have premonitions
Every single word I spit is ammunition
Gassing on the competition
Never break a sweat
This **** is practice like an exhibition
**** persmission
I ain't never asking
I don’t need forgiveness
That’s is weakness
Only time I’ll bow is when I’m meeting Jesus
That is genius
Let a **** ***** hate
Went from nothing into something
Watch a ***** go great
So what you gon say what you gon do
How you gonna let a janitoring ***** outperform you
I came from the bottom
and I swear I’m here to warn you
That everything I do is destiny
Cause I was born to
Seek and disarm you
Eat in regards to
Every other rapper vs me
is just partial
On a ******* mission that’s comparable to
Marshall Pac Big Cole Jay Nas
**** you
Even if you want to hate on me
I will still love you
****** throwing dirt all on my name I can’t trust you
Climbing to the top ya it’s something that I must do
That I must do!
It's Dax!
Chase your dreams
When people say it about you
says more about them
Never forget that

I wish i wasn't black
I wish that i was brave
I wish,I wish,I wish with everyone candle on the cake
That i could quit doin' these drugs
But i can't and i'm afraid
I wish that i was smart
I wish that i was rich
I wish it wasn't hard for me to grow up and forgive
I wish that i could help
I wish i wasn't sick
I wish that I was Tom MacDonald,I'd be just like
I wish i wasn't sober
I miss it when the party wasn't over
Happiness was right around the corner
Every single night was like the best one of our lives
Now we are older
The good ol’days are out of reach, i wsh that they were closer
I wish i wasn't anxious,and i wish i could fast forward
And i wish that i could rewind but they don't make that controller
I wish the nights were longer,and i wish the day were shorter
And i wish that i could sleep enough to maintain my composure
I feel crazy,i wish that i was normal
I wish that i could kill myself but also be immortal
Take me to the oracle,i heard that times is borrowed
Can you give me back  my yesterdays, i'll give you my tomorrows?
Forget all of my morals and just live like i cannot remember sorrow
Before all of the tattoos and cornrows
I was different,I was happy,I was calmer
I was young and full of hormones
Now I'm wishin' for a time machine,I'd step into that portal and be gone
I wish on shooting stars, or were they satellites?
Maybe they were too far
I must have blown apart a million dandelions
Now they don't grow in my yard
I wish i didn't care about the day that I'd be buried
Used  to live i was ready for it,always in a hurry
Now I'm worried,all my memories are blurry
I’m just barely turnin'30 and the voice in my head are tryna hurt me
The choice that i made make me feel dirty,i was 25 at 13
I was smokin' with senors,drinkin' beer and gettin' flirty
Now the Ativan ain't workin' i need somethin' even stronger
Give me childhood,my mother and my father and my sister
And a Christmas to make up for  all the recent ones I'm missin'
While I'm tourin' the country for a  livin'
Give me a hug and a Nintendo and a toy box in the clost
Give me everthing i wish i had
Oh wait i think i got it
I'm a rapper like i always promised them i would accomplish
This is awesome man, i wish i had a friend to tell, i'd call'em
And i wonder if i jumped from  here if I'd survive the bottom
And would everyone believe me if i told ‘em i had fallen？
I'ma jump
I wish on shooting stars, or were they satellites?
Maybe they were too far
I must have blown apart a million dandelions
Now they don't grow in my yard
I wish we were kids again
Before everything was on Instagram
The thing were so simple then
Me,my tree fort,all of  my friends
Way back when,on Beaver Drive
When the floor was lava, i could fly
Wished i was big like them
Never thought i'd wanna be a kid again
I wish on shooting stars, or were they satellites?
Maybe they were too far
I must have blown apart a million dandelions
Now they don't grow in my yard
I wish on shooting stars, or were they satellites?
Maybe they were too far
I must have blown apart a million dandelions
Now they don't grow in my yard

Yeah, yeah, yeah I'mma get it right now, and never will I give up
Homie, this is food for thought, you better fill up
I'm coming in strong when this song ain’t very long
So I gotta make you understand before the beat is gone
Homie you are not alone, we are in the zone
We are in The Matrix, full of that fake ****
Make you wanna grab the gat and go ape ****
Living in a world of lies I can't take it
Needed someone to save me, Needed someone to hug me
Needed a whole world but nobody would love me
And I learned from this that people wanna buck me
And I've learned from this, to put no one above me
I said I can't take it I know I'm gonna make it
I know I'm not normal but I gotta fake it
I swear I'm not cocky, I am just confident
That when I step on the stage I am dominant and now I am beggin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out darling
Sick of living in the dark so I'm begging for the light
Feeling like I'm in a fight every single time a write
Cause I gotta make sure that they hear me right
Told me that I couldn't do it so when I pick up the mic
I gotta kill it with something so real that when they hear it
They can feel what's in my soul
Lyrical cokehead yeah homie I gotta blow
But first they gotta know who I is
So I'm begging for recognition on the mission just to do it big
Cause I ain't new to this I'm true to this
Thinking I'mma stand up and roll out Homie that's ludacris
Not here to play no games, I’m here to stay and make a change
In major ways so I remain
Up in the studio for days and days
Spittin' out these razorblades, don't wanna place no blame
But without you, I couldn't get to where I'm heading
So to everybody, I'm begging
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out darling
Yeah , Yeah , I said this is my path don't mess with me
I didn't choose this life it was destiny
God tested me to find the best of me
And I know I'm going to make it even without a degree
Cause the test scores don't mean **** to me
And when you said that I would fail it didn't get to me
Now I'm begging, public masses, please
I'm way too proud to get down on my knees
But I'm begging, put me on the level
**** Illuminati, that's word to the devil
Cause I am not about that, I just wanna love
I just wanna grow, I just wanna learn
The passion, it burns to write this music
I'm so late that I just might lose it
But don't ever confuse it, it's all so worth it
I just wanna help hip-hop, not hurt it
And as for my style I don't know how to word it
Why do you even have to categorize me?
**** it let 'em hate, let 'em all despise me
Cause I'm gonna take this, flip it up and make this
Something that the whole word cannot imagine
Let alone fathom I'm from another planet
I swear I'm not manic, listen to me dammit
My future's in your hands and so I'm beggin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out darling
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby

Seen a lot of ****
Yeah
Seen a lot of ****
I've seen a lot of **** I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corners selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door
While gripping a 44
I was just a youngin' but this type of **** I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed ************ grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace, and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn you evil
And just don't understand cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of ****, but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though

But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease

Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that **** is ours
They never thought I'd make it shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a cold world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, woah
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack, till the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seek though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that **** is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a ****, my mind stays celibate
Run quick, tell a *****, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like elephants
My flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor
Murder all rappers in front of they momma's

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring the trauma
Overseas ya we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the U.S.A, the big C.I.A
The bloods and the crips, and the KKK
But if you only got love for your own ways
Then you only leave space to discriminate
To discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man ya gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate, to the love ya'll

Where is the love, the love, my love
it just ain't the same
old ways have changed
new days are strange, is world insane?
if love and peace is so strong
why are there pieces of love that don't belong
nations droppin' bombs
chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
with ongoin' sufferin', as the youth die young
so ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone
so I can ask myself, really what is going wrong
with this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
makin wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
a war is goin' on but the reason's under cover
the truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
if you never know truth, then you never know love
where's the love ya'll? (i don't know)
where's the truth ya'll? (i don't know)
and where's the love ya'll?

Where is the love, the love, my love
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
as I'm getting older, ya'll people gets colder
most of us only care about money makin'
selfishness got us followin the wrong direction
wrong information always shown by the media
negative images is the main criteria
infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
whatever happened to the values of humanity?
whatever happened to the fairness and equality
instead of spreading love we spreadin' animosity
lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
that's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
that's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
gotta keep my faith alive till love is found
now ask yourself

Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that mother****er down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
Saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?
I've been living with the demons that I got in my soul
I been thinking bout the pain that I got on my mind
My conscience only exits from the things that I did
I been praying for forgiveness of the way that I live
You can find me in the zone I swear to god I is
Ain't nobody breathing currently the words like this
I'm a different type of ***** never worried bout the funds
I was focused on progression ***** I gotta get it done
I said I tried to bring it in but ain't nobody get it once
A ***** pressure was minding I had to find a way around it
I ran a couple miles couldn't find myself
Gon' get ****ed up 'cause it always helps
Imma drown in my sorrows all by myself
On a quiet night you'll find me staring at the wall
With a somber thought
I feel like I been here before my *****
Tell me what you really know my *****
I'm insane like a mother ****er
Try to find a way to articulate
Taking plenty of time to author ridiculous text
I been giving you real even though I'm realing with stress
Turn 1 hit 2 hits 3 hits 4
I cry for help but nobody respond
My emotions goin' yeah they all up and down
My self-esteem left and my confidence squandered
Got all of this pain that I deal with alone
Are you insane like me?
Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that mother****er down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
Saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?
I been killing myself for a dream I don't even believe in
It's really entertaining when you give it your all
I put my soul upon the table all they do in ****yze it
I beseech the simple rhymes that I ain't never told nobody
When I start a rap the suicidal thoughts
Are running rampant through my mind
I made the mental find a way I guess
I can really make it vivid
So they see the clearer picture of depression pain
I can't take this shit
My god
Tell me why you put me here for
I'm gone
And I don't want to live no more
Oh lord
The pain is temporary I hope
I know
That I was not created just to waste and thats the truth
So why the **** do I feel crazy
Can't explain it
It's a feeling deep inside of me
I got no witnesses left
I know I'm lost on the path I chose
Never lie upon the record as I will not be exposed
I'm only giving reality
I'm a lyrical legend
My complimentary honesty is a rarity yes
You feed the fallacy to them but I'm not really impressed
'Cause I can read between the lines and deceitful lies
Are you insane like me?
Been in pain like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Want to change like me?
But you can't like me?
Terrified of your misery going to remain like me?
Are you insane like me?
Been in pain like me?
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me?
Just to pour that mother****er down the drain like me?
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me?
Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?
Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
Saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?

 That's a hard no, pass
 My house real big and my car go fast
 In the club smokin' Jack Harlow's gas
 But I'm about to do the d**gs that Carlos has
 Old Miami Vice, 'bout to AT4 it
 But I don't show up if they don't pay me for it
 New York, party on the eighteenth floor
 But her a** so fat that I can't ignore it
 Woo, I go crazy for it
 But to ride the rides, you gotta be eighteen for it
 No games, just some foreplay before it
 And the s*x so good, she wanna pay me for it, no
 I don't wanna hear about no drama (Nada)

 I got a whole squad, got a whole lineup (I got a)
 Oh, you tryna put a show on, huh?
 Ayy
 Oh, you tryna put a show on?
 Sipping on CÎROC got me so gone
 And her best friend bad too
 Told me don't mess with her like the Zohan (Wait, wait)
 Wait a second, hold on
 Why you still got your clothes on? (Why you, why?)
 I ain't hit this sh*t in so long (It's been a minute)
 But once I hit it, so long
 Sh*t soaking (Soaking)
 Bad *****es put me in they close friends (They do)
 From Sactown all the way to Oakland

 听你最爱弹的和弦

 好想好想单曲循环

看车辙在一侧
默默地等归客
身影动刀光交错
待山风把月吹落
却见他一双眸
问过我如何相守
记得某时某刻 也曾与他牵手
回看岁月无忧 如今却事事休
侧身就此让过 车辙碾过魂魄
从此就 收剑入鞘洒脱放下执着
不再说 万事蹉跎是一杯苦酒
情依旧 芳华却旧忽而白首 再倾杯别酒
不问人生零落 何处可避愁
旧时梦束之高阁
见明月身在云壑
许多愁又几褶
凭什么去勾勒
勾一笔他已轻诺
第二笔情深难寿
难温热他心窝
烫了手莫再回头
当时难述于口 不过二字白首
如今谢过车辙 不停留带他走
怅望落日尽头 昨日烧成烈火

like a穿过深渊后 只剩下骨架的龙
I stepped on the bone
浑浊的空气伴着风

肉被他们瓜分
人性在慢慢的下沉
长夜漫漫 run away
在黑的世界下坠着

花瓣正在枯萎
地球像是墓碑
there‘s no light
but I don't know why

We lost tomorrow
The world is turned to rubble

车后面紧跟着山崩地裂
车身被笼罩在腥红天空
沙尘暴遮住了我的面容
地面一道道裂痕 道尽涂殚 无法再穿过
周围的一切的一切都瞬间消失了被吞噬被淹没
放眼望去那熟悉的场景都已经被摧毁
忘却了美好与痛苦的回忆都零零又碎碎
血滴答滴答的滴在
地上堆积着的骷髅头上面
在破碎的世界里最后只留下了
一张张破碎的唱片

就让我们的骸骨深深抱紧埋藏在
世界的某一个角落里这次不会再分开
用尽我所有的积蓄
跟死神做一个交易
这辈子可能无法再继续
下辈子一定还做你的唯一

我知道我不是Doom slayer轻松去面对Dooms day
也害怕找不到你 离别都没说一句

飞过了天际

像是一条鱼却生在这土地
不一样的习性艰难的呼吸
We are survivors想要变成贝尔
Life is hard but i always “get up”
Look at the sun变成一抹月色
掩埋在废墟中我帮你切割
看不到找不到找不到爱 灵魂的低频闪烁像你还在
被黑暗吞掉没了理性I might 你指引我站在right side

有什么心事还无法释怀
我们总把人生想得太坏
像旁人不允许我们的怪
每一片与众不同的云彩
都需要找到天空去存在
我们都习惯了原地徘徊
却无法习惯被依赖
你给我 这一辈子都不想失联的爱
相信爱的征途就是星辰大海
美好剧情 不会更改
是命运最好的安排
你是我
这一辈子都不想失联的爱
何苦残忍逼我把手轻轻放开
请快回来 想听你说
说你还在

走过陪你看流星的天台
熬过失去你漫长的等待
好担心没人懂你的无奈
离开我谁还把你当小孩
我猜你一定也会想念我
也怕我失落在茫茫人海
没关系只要你肯回头望
会发现我一直都在
你给我 这一辈子都不想失联的爱
你的每条讯息都是心跳节拍
每秒都想 拥你入怀
全世界你最可爱
你是我 这一辈子都不想失联的爱
就算你的呼吸远在千山之外
请你相信 我给的爱
值得你爱

 I done seen him take so many drugs then say his body numb
 I done seen the littlest n***a walk 'round with a Tommy gun
 He couldn't get no good time for his cash, he was fightin' bodily harm
 Once you hit the fed system, just know your body marked
 Went inside that crib, got thirty years, I had to incite an alarm
 It don't mean he got no bag, 'cause he got a icy arm
 Let them n****s name they own weed, that's why the price is wrong
 Definition of my brother, ridin' right or wrong
 Ride around your block, we slidin' late night, yeah
 See a five pack, we takin' at least four lifes, yeah
 Ain't talkin' about exhaust when I say we got four pipes, yeah
 My city feel like Chiraq, gotta keep my pole tight, yeah
 Got perico the color middle of a Klondike
 Ain't got nos I'm ridin' with my bro, fear wrong or right
 When I go back to the block I grew up on and roll dice
 I'm creatin' no hierarchy, pull up with no ice

 Yeah
 Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now
 Baby, I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down
 Baby, we took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town
 Baby, where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
 Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
 Been wakin' up in the crib but sometimes I don’t even know where I'm at
 Please don't play that nigga songs at this party, I can't even listen to that
 Anytime that I ran into somebody it must be a victory lap, ayy
 Shawty come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snapped
 This in between us is not like a store, this isn't an closeable gap, ayy
 I see some niggas attack, and don't end up makin' it back
 I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
 What they had didn't last, damn baby
 Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now
 Baby, I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down
 Baby, we took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town
 Baby, where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
 I'm in the trenches, relax
 Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
 We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tay is the best
 Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the neck
 I'm like the DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me you will get stretched, ooh-oh
 Ran dracs in the hood, surround Drake around dracs
 Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
 And I never been in grace and the money's hard to make
 So I bet they on they face right now
 I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
 What they had didn't last, damn baby
 Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now
 Baby, I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down
 Baby, we took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town
 Baby, where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
 When he tell the story, that's not how it ain't how it went
 Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
 Moved out of Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent
 Gotta just call me to tell come and get it
 Got that boy off and I don't want the credit
 If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
 Left me for dead and now they want debit, yeah
 Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
 Backyard it look like the Garden of Eden
 Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
 And then shawty came back, she said she didn't mean it
 It's hard to believe in
 I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
 What they had didn't last, damn baby
 Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now

Just give me some time tonight

And it turns out this glass on the floor
Has fallen right out of my chest

 Never show me shit every time I wake up
 All alone till I hit another great plug
 Got another 30 xans off the pay stubs
 Wake up and wanna empty out a full clip
 I'm sick and tired of this bullshit
 Get a secret life and I can't even try
 No one cares its all a lie
 The ones that hold me tight
 Don't believe in me end of the night
 We been on a roll
 I don't think that they know
 Heart been feeling cold
 That's just something you know
 LiL shawty I don't ever wanna fight
 CBX frozen city I been up all night
 I was laying in the dark I just wanna see the light
 Ain't nobody down to ride when I pull up at night
 Wake up feeling like I'm less and I don't wanna be that
 So I'm speaking from my chest hoping that I never lack
 Watch me hop out this bugatti
 It say fendi on the bag

 I would and buy you all of that

I hope it'll be a good day
They say I stumble when I walk
But they don't see I move my feet
At least forward in my sleep
I wake up from dreams that
Folded into nightmares
The night tears my eyes wide open in the sheets
I wrestle with demons
Pieces of my mind scatter swiftly into air
When I talk to all these people that I care about
Air it out, that's just what my therapist's been saying
She been helping me with scary thoughts and
Girls I really like a lot
I been trying hard to fix myself this year
'Cause I was thinking, I wouldn't even be here
So I been trying hard to fix myself this year
'Cause I was thinking, I wouldn't even be here
I hope it'll be a good day
I hope it'll be a good day
I've been moving slower in my dreams
And I don't know what it means, but it's exactly what it seems
This depression comes in waves, like I'm sailing out over seas
They see me crying, feel the knives inside poking me as we speak
Lost atop the balcony
What is my reality
I can't come back to earth 'cause I'm
Losing grip of my gravity
Good luck with catching me
A failure of a masterpiece
I tear apart these wings
That I used to fight with so gallantly
I am not a hero, please don't group me with them
I've never saved nobody's life, I'd rather soak in their dread
A waste of oxygen, on top of that, I'm better off dead
I tend to wounds that never heal, and ease the pain with the meds
I'm very stressed, well aware of this position that I've taken up
Tell you all these stories people try to say I'm making up
Sorry that I got the drama, maybe I don't pray enough
I'm coming from a place where nobody thought I'd be brave and uhm...
